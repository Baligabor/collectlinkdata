    "content": "This essay in Paul Rosenberg‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA Lodging of Wayfaring Men‚Äù has never been more important than it is today. \n\nFARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY\n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn't know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families.\n\n It began to break out when the deep superstition of the Middle Ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far-off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over 100 years.\n\nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the greatest discovery of the modern era, the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It's the operation of creation using the only counter-entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab to the front office to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service. And it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skills overcome a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do, to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion. It cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world. Within several decades, their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their kings, seeking permissions from rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and breaking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild, as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the Middle Ages and not much else. Do you think that people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not. You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äî human energy ‚Äî creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves, are of little worth, and when you add human creativity, you can create vehicles, computers, and spaceships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of Earth. If they could have turned into something great of themselves, they would have done it long ago. But they cannot. It is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of material becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey, who do not play the positive-sum game, instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is, ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚ÄîThe idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks at the ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth‚Äô, but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experience of communism has taught the world's rulers that the positive sum game is necessary, so their plan is now to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it altogether. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world on our backs. Are worth half of our efforts ‚Äî half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees, and regulations. For what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor‚Äù, they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further, that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is it not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so, or to even consider it.\n\nAre the poor better off? Certainly. Some of our money goes to the poor. (Although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy.) This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you.\n\nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat praises like, ‚Äúwell, that's the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them. You are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice of either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and I realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s, then slowly the curves and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had, as a writer once said, been geared for giants. But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive sum game, only to slow it down. Only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half-speed. Yet, its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum game during my lifetime: Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the East in one generation. An explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and still-born! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats worldwide. Where will it go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled? Or will it migrate to new and open lands? But, moving to a new land will be a problem, won't it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found: Cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants, establish the positive-sum game without restriction. Toward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it and we've broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment and see if freedom really is better than servitude. Why won't they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind? Or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want to do is be left alone to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us?",

    "content": "MA: Frances, are you ready?\n\nJF: Yes, I am.\n\nMA: OK, hang on and I‚Äôll post some reasons why these ideas bother\npeople. Take a look through the list, and see which ones seem to fit you.\n\nThe first one probably doesn‚Äôt fit you, but I‚Äôm leaving it in because it does fit a lot of people. Remember also that people don‚Äôt really think about these things, they just react.\n\nMA:\n\n1. Fear of responsibility. Freedom is threatening because it eliminates the possibility of shifting responsibility for your errors onto others. Freedom puts you right out in the open, with no cloak for your mistakes. It also gives you full credit for your successes, but that is seldom considered, as the fear-based impulses are generally stronger.\n\n2. Fear of separation. For a variety of reasons, most people have an\ninstinctual fear of being separate. The feeling is that separation means death. This may be true in some rare situations, and certainly was true more commonly in the distant past, but it is an impulse only, not reason.\n\n3. Rulership as a force of nature. For the last several thousand years,\nnearly all humans have lived and died under some form of rulership. So many generations have come and gone under this arrangement, that it now seems to most people as a force of nature: That which was, is, and shall be. When you mention something different, it causes them  mental stress.\n\n4. No mental image. Because none of us have ever lived in any situation except subjection to state power, we have no mental images of anything different. So, when we start talking about a truly free place with no rulers, the listeners have no images to draw upon. It seems like we are proposing a pointless journey into an unknown and dangerous place. Again, this is a feeling, not reasoned thought.\n\n5. Group conditioning. A central fact of modern social behavior is that almost the entire populace has gone through 11-17 years of social conditioning in the school systems. This conditioning shows up in a variety of ways, especially in dealing with authority figures. The conditioned responses are: Obey authority. Don‚Äôt cause a disruption. Accept the place given to you. Conform. The real effect here is the installing of comfortreactions and discomfort-reactions. Our system flies in the face of almost all of this.\n\n6. Lack of critical thinking skills. For a variety of reasons (which I have not spent the time necessary to properly catalog), the 20th Century saw a mass movement away from respect for reason and toward a devotion to emotion. Have you ever tried to reason with someone who lives by emotion? It is essentially impossible. These people can be influenced by getting them to identify with characters from movies and television, or with celebrities, but seldom by reason. Now, most people aren‚Äôt fully that way, but modern critical thinking skills are disastrous, and a great many people distrust reason, with full faith in emotion. Many of them are beyond hope of recovery, and could be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.\n\n7. Cognitive dissonance. This is what happens to people when they have accepted an idea, or series of complimentary ideas; then, an obviously different idea is presented, and it makes some sort of sense to them. It causes a conflict. This is properly called cognitive dissonance, and it is really just a mental conflict. People don‚Äôt do well with these conflicts; their general reaction is to eliminate them as quickly as possible. The easiest way to do this is to simply drown them out by reciting their original ideas, and trying to convince themselves that the previous ideas are right, and 148 that they should not think about the new idea. Yes, this is dishonest, and yes, it requires denial, but most people prefer it to critical analysis of their existing ideas, and, potentially, changing their minds. Combine this with all the other items shown here, and the conflicts arising from taking on a difficult new idea are too much for many people to bear.\n\n8. Fear of reprisal. This is the simplest one. Think of an IRS audit, an FBI raid, or of Stalin. Obviously the rulers won‚Äôt like our free markets. It is not unreasonable to expect that they will take reprisals against people who displease them. A very reasonable concern.\n\n9. Fear of the world falling apart. The central myth of the nation-state is that it is necessary to hold civilization together; that without it, we would all degenerate quickly into killers and thieves. This has been repeated so frequently and so consistently, that most people accept it as fact, even though if asked to provide evidence, they have none. Actual analysis of this idea leads to a contrary conclusion, but that does not stop the impulse of fear. Very few people have ever questioned the nation-state myth at all.\n\nI suggest that you print this out, take a few minutes, and think about it. I‚Äôll be in my office for several hours. Just let me know when you are ready.\n\n- Paul Rosenberg,  A Lodging of Wayfaring Men (p. 147-148)\n\n- - -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvfPI1t9Rck",

    "content": "BitBox Lugano Update is here! üéâ\n\nAt BitBox, we want to make sure our users can take advantage of the newest innovations on Bitcoin. With today‚Äôs update, we are adding support for two great Bitcoin features:\n\n- Silent Payments\n- MiniTapscript\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfau.webp \n\nüîí¬†Silent Payments Upgrade\n\nWith this update, the BitBox02 is now the first hardware wallet to support sending to silent payment addresses. This means you can send bitcoin to the same address multiple times, without the sender losing privacy. No need to constantly generate new addresses!\n\nüîß Just enter a silent payment address in the BitBoxApp, and the transaction is created  together with your BitBox02. \n\nThe BitBoxApp then verifies the silent payment was created correctly by the BitBox02 for extra security.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfav.png \n\nüîë¬†This update also brings MiniTapscript, combining the privacy and efficiency of Taproot with the power of Miniscript. It‚Äôs perfect for creating more complex wallet setups like inheritance planning, while keeping transactions smaller and more private.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfaz.png \n\nWhat is MiniTapscript? \n\nMiniscript is a language that simplifies creating advanced Bitcoin spending conditions, like combining keys or setting time delays (great for inheritance planning).\n\nMiniTapscript adds Taproot‚Äôs privacy and efficiency to Miniscript. Only the part of the script actually used to spend the coins is revealed, which reduces transaction size, lowers fees, and improves privacy.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/LfbD.png \n\nWith MiniTapscript, only the necessary parts of the script are revealed, making transactions more efficient and lowering fees. It‚Äôs available now in firmware version 9.21.0.\n\nWhat else is included in our upgrade? Read more in the blogpost in the comment üëá",

    "content": "In the early days of ecash a common narrative was that it provides \"theoretically perfect anonymity\", but there's more nuance to this. \n\nIt's correct that when the client presents an unblinded signed message, the mint cannot link this to any specific blinded cyphertext that it signed previously. \n\nHowever, there is still three pieces of critical metadata that the client does reveal:\n\n1. The number of inputs and outputs of the ecash transaction. Transactions with many inputs reveal that the same user got paid many times in the past. Transactions with many outputs reveal that one user is making many payments.\n\n2. The value of each input and output. The mint uses a different key for each denomination value of the tokens. Thus a token worth 5 units is easily differentiated from a token worth 10 units. The anonymity set of a token depends on the number of tokens generated, so if a user is the only one with that specific denomination he has no privacy. \n\n3. The IP address that connects to the mint to send the transaction api request. If the same IP address makes multiple payments, it's likely the same user, and his geolocation is also revealed.\n\nProblems 1 and 2 can be mitigated on client side, but this adds substantial complexity in utxo management and transaction structure. If these mitigation are not specified and different clients have slightly different solutions, this opens up additional client fingerprinting attacks.\n\nWabiSabi is designed to solve problems 1 and 2 on a protocol level. A WabiSabi transaction is required to have exactly two inputs and two outputs, and homomorphic value commitments hide the amounts of each input and output. The tradeoff is that the mint has to issue 0 value credentials, a user needs to make more transactions to prepare his desired amounts, and the proof size and creation time is larger.\n\nProblem 3 is addressed by a client side networking anonymity layer. A VPN at least hides the actual users IP address, but if only one client uses this VPN to talk to this mint, it's still one IP per user. Tor is incredibly useful here, as it allows the creation of anonymous onion routes through the network with different exit IP addresses. A client can get a new IP for each api request! This does however increase bandwidth and latency cost.\n\nWe should assume \"everyone knows what the mint knows\", and so we need to be hardcore about privacy protections best baked into the protocol. If the protocol doesn't ensure the security of the user, client devs have to do an exponentially larger amount of research and development to fix the issues client side.",

I strongly believe authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans. Check üßµ for why:\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laim.png \n\nRather than praising bitcoin as a tech paradigm shift √† la petroleum and the internet, the authors introduce the blatantly luddite argument that \"early adopters\" ... \"increase their real wealth and consumption\" ... \"at the expense of [latecomers]\".\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lain.png \n\nThen they go on to brazenly advocate for legislation ... \"to prevent bitcoin prices from rising or to see bitcoin disappear altogether\" in order to prevent \"the division of society\".\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laio.png \n\nThe authors also model some projections, to illustrate the paltry amount of BTC that will remain available for latecomers. (Woe is me! Conspicuously left out is the reason that has driven 15 years of bitcoin adoption & development: it's simply better tech.)\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laiq.png \n\n In all the years I've been monitoring the bitcoin space, this is by far the most aggressive paper to come from authorities. The gloves are off. It's clear that these central bank economists now see bitcoin as an existential threat, to be attacked with any means possible.\n\nMany of us have warned that this was coming: bitcoin as a major political fault line both in national and international elections. Well here it is. It means that us HODLers must take action to insure that governments respect our basic right to hold property.\n\nAnd no, this won't be a war between haves and have-nots. Rather this will be a historic clash between those who stand for the natural rights of the individual, and those who clutch at the failed ideologies of collectivism and central planning.\n\nHere's the download link to the paper: \"The distributional consequences of Bitcoin\".

There has always been confusion over the word \"Free\" in \"Free Software\" and \"Open\" now suffers the same problem (look at all these LLM licenses claiming to be Open Source), and I think \"Freedom Tech\" is a pretty good way of talking about the same thing.\n\nThe Free/Libre Open Source Software community has a lot of overlap and similarity but can be split into two camps:\n\n1. I am truly free if I am allowed to contract myself into slavery (BSD-ish, permissive licensing).\n2. It is not freedom to be allowed to contract myself into slavery (GNU-ish, copyleft licensing).\n\nMaybe that's an unfair or unrealistic characterization but that's how I tend to think of it.\n\nI disagree with a lot of Stallman's views (he's on the left) but the four software freedoms are legit.

A note mixer relay - a simple yet intriguing concept. Essentially, it's a relay that accepts your notes, but instead of store them, it re-signs them with the relay's keys, effectively anonymizing and mixing your notes. This is the npub I'm using for this and where all mixed notes are published nostr:nprofile1qqs80keaa6v84ldnkne66q0qf96rvtf84aj27taw25x3appz83lqspgppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp07t6hp6 . \n\nThis idea isn't entirely new, there was some exploration around group of people sharing an nsec. This is the case of nostr:nprofile1qqswgh9y2cz5qu5upzg5yn47m65t7d697k2dtufa9fq54af80dwng5sprpmhxue69uhkummnw3ezucmgv95k6cfwd9hxvme0qyw8wumn8ghj7cn0wd68ytn0wfskuem9wdukuceww3jkx6p0ksrqpx, for example, it was created during sec01.\n\nIn summary, this note mixer relay will accept your notes, re-sign them with the relay's keys, and then publish them. Does this idea interest you, or does it make sense? Currently, anyone can publish to the relay, but I plan to implement a whitelist for pubkeys based on my contact list. This could also be integrated with a wot relay, allowing you to mix notes from your friends or entire social graph. Perhaps there are some interesting use cases to explore? ü§î\n\nJust a heads up: be careful not to publish to multiple relays, as this will leak your original note, signed by you.",

    "content": "Why I started Sovereign Landing\n\nI've been location independent for over 8 years. Nomadic lifestyle isn't easy, but Sovereign Landing solves my biggest pain...\n\nDuring these 8 years, at times I've attempted to have just one permanent base. Every time I try, reality seems to start sending me subtle or not-so-subtle hints that I shouldn't even be trying that... so I'm now leaning 100% into a semi-mobile lifestyle - permanently.\n\nI'm not constantly moving around because that would be just a ton of wasted energy, but I'm not living anywhere permanently either. A few different places per year.\n\nThis comes with some issues of course. Nomadic lifestyle is especially challenging over the long term - most people who try this just give up. Many find lack of community the worst aspect, but I've never really cared about that - my communities have always been online.\n\nWhat I personally find the most difficult is the actual moving - having to find a new apartment in a new country, and setting it up. That's tolerable to do maybe once, but the frustration compounds over time.\n\nThis happened again in the beginning of 2024. I was busy with life and knew I wanted to go to Tbilisi, Georgia, so I did. I just thought I'd get a temporary Airbnb while I find an actual longer-term rental. Should be easy, right?\n\nWell, it's never that simple, and that hit me once again when I started the apartment hunting process. I remembered vividly what absolute drain of energy it is. It usually means weeks of focus destroyed.\n\nThat's true even if you hire local help, as that hiring process by itself can be long and arduous! If the first person you hire can't get the job done (somewhat likely!) you have to start from scratch - fffffuuuuu...\n\nI did find a good reliable local person in Tbilisi (Nina), and during her apartment hunting I just couldn't help thinking \"if this thing here and that thing there was done slightly differently, this could be like 10-100x easier\". These things kept popping up in my head.\n\nNina was working as a real estate agent part time, and when she mentioned that she could have time for more customers, I just put 1+1+1 together.\n\nI know something about online marketing. Nina is an expert on the local market. And I'm definitely an expert on taking sort-of-functional processes, ripping them apart and turning them into great customer experiences. That's how the idea of Sovereign Landing got started!\n\nI've been building this project primarily with myself as the primary customer avatar, but it's now high time to start getting some market feedback from OTHER people - preferably customers! üòÄ\n\nI'd highly appreciate it if you can check out the site and let me hear your thoughts?\n\nhttps://www.sovereignlanding.com/",

This part of the conversation was such gold that I made it into a separate clip: https://m.primal.net/LJjL.mp4 \n\nThis part of the conversation is about the book Second Realm: https://libertyunderattack.com/product/second-realm-book-on-strategy/ (you can download and listen to it for free)\n\nMy highlights from the conversation in text:\n\n[Gsovereignty]\n\n...We can also orange-pill the world by hiring everyone...\n\n[Max]\nYeah, cause ultimately free people are productive people and productive people want to build stuff...\n\nNot just do we need to produce services and goods in the 2nd realm that cannot be acquired in the 1st realm, but likewise there is a demand in the 2nd realm that cannot be provided or satisfied in the 1st realm... and so then 1st realm agents will migrate into the 2nd realm in order to produce those goods and services for 2nd realm inhabitants.\n\n[Gsovereignty]\nI think I will take that hint and start referring to the bitcoin world as the 2nd realm\n\n[Max]\nYeah it's a perfect fit...\n\n... (Second Realm) It's a book on strategy, how to build a productive parallel society that gets humanity through this dark time of parasitism. We need to have people continuously producing, DESPITE the enormous amount of theft that is going on, and we need to build tools and strategies that make being productive cheaper.\n\nThere is a gigantic demand in this area, and therefore huge opportunities for value creation and profit.\n\nSo, this is ultimately I think what is going for us, like back during the Soviet regime: you had the Soviet economy, centrally planned and everything going to shit and rotting and no value being created at all, and you had the much more liberal western societies with more free market producing enormous amounts of incredible things.\n\nYou just see the two markets and centrally planned slavery societies always underperform property-rights based freedom societies, like always has, always been, will always be... just because of economic reality.\n\nSo in the long run we will see exactly the same thing happening again: the first realm, centrally managed, fiat-controlled and slave/theft based system is going to dwindle and further decrease in capital.\n\nIt will devour itself more and more, and as it is dying it will have to devour itself even at a faster rate, just to keep up. While simultaneously the free world will produce things that we cannot even yet imagine, at a scale we cannot even fathom...\n\n...and that will continue to increase, as we continue to write the code that decreases the cost for doing so, and we're not stopping to write the code!\n\nThe full episode is here: https://fountain.fm/episode/1UPPuhyd3St7E3RCpBsX",

    "content": "NEW CLIENT ANNOUNCEMENT\nhttps://m.primal.net/LDNn.mp4 \nI wanted to build on nostr and I asked OpenSats for a grant to work on ONOSENDAI one day per week. I scaled back my hours at my fiat job and began part time nostr development to work on a novel metaverse project where all actions require proof of work. This was the beginning of my nostr career. Today is a huge milestone in that journey.\n\nIt took me 52 Fridays from proof of concept to reality, and now ONOSENDAI functions as the first cyberspace client.\n\nToday I present to you the thermodynamic update to #ONOSENDAI https://onosendai.tech\n#welcometocyberspace folks. It's finally here. Check it out on desktop for the best experience. More updates for a better Mobile experience are in the pipeline.\n\nI'm working on a video to explain cyberspace and how to use ONOSENDAI and I'll post it ASAP.\n\nThe short tutorial is this:\n- WASD for movement (relative to camera)\n- Q = down, E = up\n- ESC to put camera behind avatar\n- Mouse Click and drag to move camera\n- Mouse Wheel to change Throttle\n\nSections of the app:\n\nLOCAL\nThis is the on-the-ground cyberspace view. The shiny polygon you begin your journey in is your Home Coordinate, which is simply your hex pubkey. Your journey always starts here if you derezz (or get derezzed) at any point, but your progress is saved to nostr and your avatar will travel even when you're away from the app!\n\nSECTOR\nThis is the 10,000ft view of cyberspace. Nearby sectors are automatically scanned for objects of interest and mapped in 3D: other avatars, hyperjumps, shards, and constructs (coming soon).\n\nGLOBAL\nThis is the 100,000,000ft view of cyberspace. The staggeringly large full coordinate system is shown.\n\nBUILD\nThis tab is a 3D editor that lets you build 3D objects called Shards. Shards can be mined and planted wherever you are at in cyberspace for everyone to admire. In the LOCAL tab you can mine and deploy a Shard at your current position. The size and complexity of the shard determines its mining difficulty.\n\nTerminology:\n\n- coord - a cyberspace coordinate is a 256-bit number, just like event ids and public keys.\n- chain - the nostr events representing your movement which contain proof-of-work and are linked together via hash\n- sector - a 2^30 cube area of cyberspace\n- G - Gibson, the unit of measurement in cyberspace named after William Gibson (the author who invented the concept of cyberspace)\n- plane - The last bit in a cyberspace coordinate determines its plane. Depending on your pubkey you will either be in D-Space or I-Space. You will be able to switch planes in a future update. All points in D-Space map to a real point in reality, including Earth. All points in I-Space are virtual.\n\nDespite the polish I was able to muster, ONOSENDAI is still in its infancy, and so is cyberspace. It's up to you to explore, build, discover, and push it forward, because unlike other metaverses, this one belongs to everyone and is controlled by no-one. That's the whole point!\n\nI would like to invite all #cyberspace enthusiasts to join my new ditto instance at https://straylight.cafe and use your nostr identity to ask questions, discuss cyberspace, futurism, and how to build this new world together. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. I want to shut down the ONOSENDAI telegram group in favor of Straylight Caf√© because it's nostr based, so hop on over and make it happen!\n\nWhen you join Straylight.cafe, it isn't connected to any external relays on purpose, so you must edit your profile and customize it for how you want your npub to appear on this site. Whatever you post on Straylight stays there and doesn't go out to the rest of nostr unless you do so manually. It's like an open telegram group -- public, but not broadcasted by default.\n\nAnd so concludes my OpenSats grant. I want to thank so many people for supporting me, encouraging me, and helping me along this journey.\nI am going to try to list everyone I can and I apologize if I miss someone:\nOpenSats and the whole team there\nGsovereignty and Bitkarrot for having me on their podcast. This was a huge break for me into the nostr scene.\nJohns and Marina for encouraging me and inviting me to awesome bolt.fun hackathons which were a wonderful opportunity to meet great people!\nbnonni for being my first ONOSENDAI contributor\nChris for donating to support my work on cyberspace\nlaoc42 \n42pupusas for being the first to build on the cyberspace protocol\nCryptoClay for his enthusiasm and support\nNik, for bringing life and sound to cyberspace with his videos\nPablo for bragging about me and sharing his contagious enthusiasm\nJeffG for answering my NDK questions and being a good bro\nSimon for donating to support my work on cyberspace\nthe FanFares team\nAVERAGE_GARY for thoughtful consideration and friendship\nArtur Brugeman\nJ@n, for having me on his podcast and being an awesome friend\nIoni Appleberg\nMichael Tidwell\nSer Sleepy\nJay\nQuiet Warrior\nAvi\nholdbod\nhzrd149\nMax\nMax Hillebrand\nbiscuits\nmetamick and paula\njonb\nshaun, isaac, yofu, and the yakihonne crew. They throw great hackathons and are wonderful people!\njeanpaul\nFiatjaf\nhttps://m.primal.net/LFjl.png\nStephen Mosher and his crew\nall of my faithful and beloved reply guys who hype me up when I post about cyberspace\nEveryone in the telegram group and everyone who has zapped, tested, and waited patiently for this\nEveryone who believed in me and the skeptics who pushed me to the finish line\n\nThis is just the beginning. Nostr isn't just for tweets. It's for cyberspace, and I think that's a big deal. Thanks everyone üëæüíú\n\n#OTHERSTUFF",

Some of those arrows were, and continue to be, unjust.  Some of those arrows were of my own causing.  I am not perfect.\n\nI don‚Äôt want a perfect world.  I want a world where I‚Äôm not reliant upon the desires of others to control and extort me and where I‚Äôm respected enough to be left alone to do my thing so long as it doesn‚Äôt harm others unjustly.\n\nThe desire to effect this declaration already exists in many of us.  No sane person likes to be controlled or have impositions forced upon him or her.  At the end of the day, we the people give others the power to do things against us.  We sit in relatively quiet outrage, not wanting to rock the boat, not wanting others to perceive us as crazy, and not doing anything about it.  Though, in a sense, participating in #Nostr and #Bitcoin is doing something about it.  It‚Äôs setting a direction toward what we believe is a better and more just society for us to live.  For this I am encouraged that the options are available to each of us to participate or not as we see fit in a way that has not been available to us before.\n\nDecentralization may seem like chaos to some, but that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt yet understand what it is and means.  They don‚Äôt understand that these systems are about taking back control from the privileged few.  The proof is in the pudding.  Our systems seem to be working.  Each of us are free to participate or not in these decentralized systems.  We know the rules ahead of time and we know that change is truly of consensus, rather than this fake show the ruling class foists upon us without consideration of our input or desires. nostr:note10qp726g4zffsgs05l83a5e7hx42rsqhx4urvmtg6g8xtnu4qxjpsgaxy4d",

We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

Spending a taproot input is 16% cheaper compared to spending a native segwit input. Users aren‚Äôt the only ones that benefit - Bitcoin nodes can verify taproot‚Äôs signatures faster than legacy ones, so the entire network gets a little speed boost.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/KvGi.png \n\nüöÄ Faster transaction broadcasting\n\nA more sophisticated transaction broadcasting mechanism was introduced to make the process faster. Transactions are now broadcast to multiple nodes in parallel (through the Tor network) and fail more quickly if the transaction is rejected by the network. Users who upgrade will notice it now takes half as long to send their coins.\n\nüîç Help to setup and find a coordinator\n\nA new message is now shown when no coordinator is configured, along with some help to understand how to find and setup one.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/KvGe.png \n\n‚è´ More accurate CPFP fee estimation\n\nThe CPFP feature now takes into account the fee paid by the parent transaction. In previous releases, the child transaction assumed the parent paid 0 sats in fees, and thus always overpaid for the speed up.. This improvement will be especially significant in high-fee environments, where the CPFP feature is most useful!\n\nüìâ Safer protocol\n\nIn order to avoid introducing unknown incentives and to limit risk to users, the coordination fee concept has been removed. Only coinjoin coordinators that don't charge any coordination fee continue to be supported. Read more: https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/killing-coordination-fee/\n\nü™≤ Backend optimizations\n\nUsers who run a Wasabi backend can now do so with a pruned node and significant CPU/RAM savings. This makes hosting a backend much cheaper and helps to decentralize this component which Wasabi clients still depend on.",

Trading in foreign currency is illegal and businesses are subject to rationing. As a result, there is a growing black market for everything.\n\nElliot Vreeland, son of Nobel Laureate Austrian School economist Dr. Martin Vreeland, learns of his father's apparent death, and is rushed home from school. Elliot learns his father has faked his death to escape arrest by the government agents who are detaining \"radicals\" accused of worsening the economic crisis. Elliot is sent by his father to collect some gold coins stored in case the family has to escape.\n\nUpon returning home, Elliot finds his family missing. Government agents enter the house searching for Elliot, who manages to escape.\n\nElliot becomes acquainted with the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre, an organization plotting the end of the government agents by means of counter-economics. The cadre is strong and organized, and has its militia. Elliot enlists their help, and meets Lorimer, a girl hiding from the government agents; they develop a relationship.\n\nAs the government agents weaken, they tighten controls on communication, travel, and trade. This fails to avert economic collapse, causing the private sector ‚Äì unions, syndicates, and individuals outside of these organizations ‚Äì to control the old infrastructure.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alongside_Night",

I joined them a few times because there wasn‚Äôt much else to do, but for them, it was something a bit more serious‚Äîit was a small but important source of income that they gave to their mothers. It was easy work, and customers appreciated it and tip them for their help.\n\nThen, one day, someone decided to prohibit all forms of child labor. A few years later, the streets were full of kids cleaning car windows, others tried playing violin, singing on the sidewalks or simply asking for money, activities that noone find valuable. \n\nThe sense of pride my friend once had from earning a few pesos by providing a useful service had now been replaced by a naturalized shame of relying on pity from strangers.",

This is the default level and is usually used by people who don't know or don't care about signature levels. A lot of people don't specify the signature level when they sign public keys, so there is no reason to discard these right away.\n\nLevel 1 signature: personal belief but no verification. As the name says this level is used when someone signs a key but was unable to verify the identity. Used for nicknames, most of the time, as you can't really prove the identity behind a pseudonym. Be careful when you encounter a level 1 signature on a key with a full name and e-mail address. These levels have to be specified manually, if someone changes it to level 1, it might be for a reason.\n\nLevel 2 signature: casual verification: These signatures usually mean that people have met and checked identification, but didn't know eachother upfront.\n\nLevel 3 signature: extensive verification: The level used when the signer was absolutely sure that the listed name is correct. Usually this means that they have known eachother in person for years and have checked government issues identification.\n\nhttps://vic.demuzere.be/articles/pgp-public-keys/",

    "content": "A train of thought coming from: \"we can't do ZKPs using sigma protocols or bulletproofs on chain, because we only have ECC operations against one generator (G)\":\n\nImagine one of the very simplest things you can do with 2 generators: proof of discrete log equivalence or DLEQ for short. This is basically the simplest possible generalization of Schnorr; one secret, two bases. This requires two ephemeral commitments (the nonce k mult. the 2 generators) and only one scalar response (one \"signature\", if you like).\n\nOf course, you can't verify such a thing on chain; you can't check sJ = R_2 + hash(..)Q where Q = xJ and P = xG. You can only verify the first version, w.r.t. G: sG = R + eP, which is ofc standard Schnorr, here bip340.\n\nBut .. is there a way adaptors could help? Because an adaptor is something you verify offchain, and so it isn't restricted to one base/ generator.\n\nImagine your goal is \"unlock a payment only if P and Q have the same DL wrt G, J\" (yes I know, bizarre, but I'm fumbling towards the first sentence, here).\n\nObviously if we're including \"verify something offchain before taking an action\", we'll find it sanest to stick to a 2 party protocol first. Let's see:\n\n1. Alice sends Bob P, Q, R1, R2 (having calculated from a random k, R1 = kG, R2 =kJ, and already knowing x_a s.t. Q=x_a J and P=x_a G); her private key is x_a\n2. Alice pays into a 2-2 multisig with Bob, where her key is P, and the aggregate key is Pagg, with U1. When Alice signs it (not yet), the signature will look like:\n\ns_a = k1 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x_a\n\nNotice the +T which will be for an adaptor that Alice adds. This process is already well understood for Schnorr multisig. I am glossing over Musig related details, claiming they don't change the following.\n\n3. Alice provides an adaptor over J for ``spending'' U1. Before writing this out, consider: we want the s-value to be the same over J as it is over G. This is problematic, because the s value comes from a structure that is basically : s = k + e*x, where e is the hash, and as per bip340, that hash *must* be exactly: H(R, P, m) where P is the onchain key, R is the onchain nonce and m is the actual transaction message. So if we do things naively, i.e. make an adaptor over the J base like:\n\ns'J = R2 + H(R2+T, Q, message)Q\n\n.. then we're going to fail to create the desired scenario: that the real signature 's' is the same between the J and G bases. In order to solve this we have to play a trick. We don't change the nonce or public key fields in the hash at all, i.e. we do:\n\ns' = k2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x\n\nand have Bob verify:\n\ns'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q\n\nSuperficially that is unsound; the reason is that such signatures can be forged if the corresponding nonce point R2 is not fixed into the hash/FS challenge, which it appears it isn't (also not \"key-prefixing\" by including the public key, here Q, in the same challenge is, at the least, problematic). However this can be solved, albeit in an unorthodox way: include both R2 and Q, which are curve points, as data inside the bitcoin transaction! (spending U1). It will just be \"dead\" data (e.g. OP_DROP) because you won't be able to sign against them; they use the wrong basepoint, but it is still easy).\n\n4. Bob verifies this adaptor using (to repeat): s'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q.\n5. Now Bob knows that if he sees the valid s for this equation, he gets the private key t of T w.r.t. J. Importantly, he also knows that if that one s corresponds to the s that is needed to spend U1, then Q and P have the discrete log equivalence property we are proving. But simply convincing Bob of a fact like that is uninteresting in itself; you can do that by simply directly sending him ZKPs of various types. So, :\n6. Alice also provides offchain a DLEQ proof that T = tJ and T2 = tG\n7. Alice makes another adaptor on a payment of another utxo U2, using the same t: s'_2 = k_3 + H(R_3 + T2, P2, m)P2.\n8. Bob now knows that if U1 is spent, it reveals s, proves that DL Q/J = P/G, and that he can spend U2 using s_2 = s'_2 + t, having extracted t from s - s', and knowing that that t value corresponds to T2.\n\nThis could be seen as \"just an adaptor based atomic swap with a bunch of extra steps\", but I'd call it more \"atomic swap gated by DLEQ\", i.e. it will fail unless Q/J = P/G holds.\n\n",

    "content": "Just to define a term (because my pedantic nature recoils at the phrase \"Righteous coercion\") \nCoercion:\n1. The act or practice of coercing. \n2. Power or ability to coerce. \n3. The act or process of coercing. \n4. The application to another of either physical or moral force. When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced. When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact of submission under force. ‚ÄúCoactus volui‚Äù (I consented under compulsion) is the condition of mind which, when there is volition forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion.\n5. Actual or threatened force for the purpose of compelling action by another person; the act of coercing.\n6. Use of physical or moral force to compel a person to do something, or to abstain from doing something, thereby depriving that person of the exercise of free will.\n7. A specific instance of coercing.\n8. Conversion of a value of one data type to a value of another data type. \n9. Using force to cause something to occur. \n\nAs far as my moral understanding none of these definitions can be performed righteously. What I think you are refering to as coercion may very well be defined as just ownership or property rights. When one is said to \"own\" something that is to say they have authoritative control of the use, maintenance, and right to exchange. Your dominion is your property. (God's dominion is everthing and God is the Progenator) Within one's property rule enforcement is not coercion because those on your property have been invited and thus agree to those rules. One cannot agree to coercion. \n\nWhen it comes to government, the only way one might say you \"Agree to the rules\" of citizenship, is to be under the illusion that you chose the government. That IS an illusion. You may be complicit in the government's actions but you have not chosen anything. This lack of free will to choose IS coercion regardless of perceptions of divinity. The scriptures are inspired by God and written by men. In so doing, they are limited by man's understanding of societal structure and dominion. It could very well be that when a polity is made of wicked men, they make a wicked government. But it is not at all clear to me, that individuals working in their own endeavors freely and collaboratively exchanging their goods and services, need a governance structure outside of their moral adherence to God's will. There is no place for interference from the state even if it could somehow act righteously (again I am unsure how taking money without permission can be righteous given the commandment expressly forbidding it.) That claim to Righteous coercion IS the illusion to which I was referring. \n\nI hope that clarifies where I seem to diverge with your view point. Peace and love, Brother.",

Still, if my kids were to do something illegal in public or to someone from a different family, the local authorities would have dominion over justice.\n\nHowever, for justice (and many other things like education/moral formation) within my family, I can exclude a father from another family from intervening in our affairs or, more importantly, excluding the state from teaching things I disapprove of. So, in that sense, I have a monopoly in my position of authority in the family.\n\nThis nuance is articulated as subsidiarity in the Catholic tradition: the principle that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, with higher authorities intervening only when necessary. The concept goes back to at least the 13th century with St. Thomas Aquinas‚Äôs Summa Theologica, but Pope Pius XI used it specifically in his papal encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, which is an important document in the history of Catholic Social Teaching.",

    "content": "I won't elaborate for him but I will add that God created a cosmos in which there is hierarchical forms of rule and authority. Christ is king of all existence. He then deligates authority to lesser powers‚Äîto his heavenly host (like angels) as well as mankind. \n\nMan as God's image bearer is to take dominion of the earth‚Äîto cultivate, subdue, and rule (as God's governors). \n\nGod also subdivided his deligated authority to man into four primary forms of government‚Äîthe church, the magistrate (state), the family, and the individual. Each government has its own specific roles and boundaries‚Äîclergy do not declare war, the magistrate does not administer the sacraments, for example. \n\nWhen man sinned and fell, and all creation was subject to sin, man's governing roles and duties did not change but are now plagued with corruption. Even in a sinful world God did not do away with government. Rather, we are told that God gave the magistrate the sword to reward the just and to punish the unjust. \n\nIn 2 Samuel God says \"When one rules justly over man, ruling in the fear of God, he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass sprout from the earth\"\n\nIn proverbs 29:2, it says \"When the rightelus increase, the people flourish, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.\"\n\nUltimately we are all under the authority and rule of Christ, whether we accept that reality or not, but not accepting it as a peoples results in evil rulers. \n\nWe individually, as households, even as towns and communities and states, can and should resist evil rulers. Part of that resistance is writing code and using open protocols (nostr) and better money (bitcoin). But the heart of that resistance needs to be repentance and a return to rightly ordered rule under the ultimate lordship of Christ.",

After almost all of us paid with sats in turn, the ice was broken. She understood that it was no more difficult or time-consuming for her as a cashier than paying by card. \n\nWhy am I writing this to you? \n\nIf we want to live the bitcoin standard, we need more merchants who accept bitcoin.

    "content": "I've been thinking this through and I've encountered two closely related problems. My outline of the naive approach is: see the \"Vcash\" section of the Curve Trees paper. The \"pour\" algorithm already does most of what you want. You build a tree of utxo pubkeys, more exactly tags of the form G__nll =hash(pubkey)G_t to use the notation of the paper. Then for each of yours, you build the commitment as C_i = v_iG_v + G_nll_i + r_i H where v is the value of the coin and r_i is a random chosen by the prover to blind the commitment. So far so normal. Then you use CurveTrees' \"Selectandrerandomise\" algo to get C_rr,i (rr means 're-randomized' commitment) along with a proof of its validity (i.e. a proof that it's in the tree.\n\nAfter doing this for every one of your utxos, you then need to attach a second zero knowledge proof, a minor adaptation of \"pour\" in Fig 6 of the paper: instead of proving zero balance from summing ins and outs in a transaction, you prove \"commitment to my claimed balance minus the sum of commitments to the list I've given has value 0\". You also need to attach a range proof for each one of the outputs, but this is also handled by spend/pour in the paper.\n\nBut in that lies the problem: if I claim an exact amount, say 100 BTC, and I have to provide a list of N utxos, I've provided already too much information, in the general case: with a very specific amount and a number it's almost trivial (usually) to crunch the public utxo set and figure out the subset that gives the exactly correct total sum. I only see two directions to correct this problem. Use a proof of range instead of exact balance (prove x > y instead of x == y), but this can be surprisingly much more difficult than proving exact values in zero knowledge. Or, some form of aggregation to avoid leaking the number of items (so instead of one c_rr per one of your keys, somehow aggregating the selectandrerandomize? not sure if that actually even makes sense ...).\n\n\nnostr:nevent1qqs90g0yjyl3a4k28tqed65fpuynn06gu6566n2x4ndftwz33ft7w4cpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsrz0tl7",

To recap:\n\nyou want to prove that you own a total of T BTC, but privately. But revealing exact amount may make it too easy to deanon. So I have a proof of this statement: \"I own N utxos, whose total value is between k and k + 2^n, for some k and n that I announce, but I am not revealing which N utxos they are, or what their individual values is, out of a given list of 300k utxos\". The code at https://github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct/tree/auditing now does this.\n\nSee the latest commit note. In brief you need 3 or 4 components to the proof: 1/ a proof that each blinded commitment is part of that 300k set, 2/a proof that each committed value, when summed together, lies in the given range (using bulletproofs), and 3/ key images per utxo to ensure you dont' cheat by just claiming the same utxo multiple times.\n\nnostr:nevent1qqsqc8wgf8w74sh2sjfpjgw4lpp7sp08vfvgpc7dvljewn3cq4grscgpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsxpc8jd",

    "content": "NWS works with and without encrypted transport. There are lots of different flavors to explore. \n\nWhen used without encryption, the entry node must be run by the user themselves because public entry nodes would be able to listen in otherwise. Two options in those cases: run the entry node locally in tandem with your (unmodified) client, or skip the entry node and modify the client so that data is sent through nostr to the exit node directly (the client is the entry node).\n\nWhen used with encryption, the entry node can also be public. If the encryption doesn't rely on certificate authorities, it just works. You have to make sure you're talking to the right person, but that problem is as old as computer science. For example, ssh will ask you to confirm the fingerprint of the server when you connect.\n\nIf the encryption is https and the certificate was issued for a normal domain, your browser will complain (do you trust this website?) and the user will have to say \"let me pass, even if insecure\". Without ugly hacks (issuing your own root cert for example), I don't know ways to circumvent this. Note that Tor services doen't support https and they don't have to since transport is always Sphinx-encrypted (even hidden from the entry node).\n\nHow do you make sure you're talking to the right server if you use https? Couldn't the entry node just send your traffic somewhete else? We can actually do something that is unique to Nostr here: the exit node can publish its own TLS certificate on nostr and sign it. That's right, you don't need an authority to do that for you if you remain within the NWS system. Clients can fetch the cert from nostr before talking to the entry node and verify against that cert. \n\nHere is another cool part that we haven't talked about yet: the exit node can also be configured to reach the global Internet and not only a local service (we call this NWS v2). In those cases, NWS can be used a bit like a VPN. You can type \"https google dot com\" in your browser and your encrypted traffic would flow from your machine to the entry node, to the exit node, then to Google and back to you. on those cases, nobody complains about the certificate because everything is fine.\n\n\nExciting shit.

Do not delay.\n\n- Use a strong, high entropy passphrase to make bruteforcing the device credential impossible if secure element is ever exploited.\n\n- Set GrapheneOS auto reboot time accordingly so encrypted data goes back at rest when the phone reboots, which makes AFU exploitation impossible. The lower the better.\n\n- Enable duress password. Set it to something easy to trigger but not easy to misfire.\n\n- Turn your phone off in a high risk situation, and trigger duress when in a duress situation.\n\n- Disable your radios when not using them (turn off Wi-Fi, use airplane mode, disable NFC, UWB etc.) for attack surface reduction.\n\n- Set an appropriate USB port control or disable the USB port so they aren't able to connect a device to it.\n\n- Use user profiles (application data and user files within profiles are stored encrypted with separate credentials).\n\n- Enable upcoming GrapheneOS security features like second factor authentication unlock when they come out.\n\n- Communicate only over secure messaging. Some apps like Molly (Signal fork) have features to encrypt the app storage with a passphrase, which access to that app's data impossible even when a profile is compromised  providing the passphrase is secure enough.\n\n- Become disassociated to data. Learn to only keep files or other data as long as it is necessary. If you have no use for them for a long time, then back it up elsewhere, encrypted. Delete anything you don't have a use for in the present. Your data is not your memories. \n\n- Remember that you are only as secure as the people you trust.

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

With NWS, you can host any existing web application on Nostr without having to use DNS or even announce your public IP to the world, simply by sharing your service's npub (or nprofile).\n\nTry it out the demo yourself. Here is a Cashu test mint running with NWS. Let's use curl to retrieve the mint's information. The request travels from your computer to the public NWS entry relay, then through nostr to the service's NWS exit relay. At the other end is a Cashu mint with HTTPS encryption.\n\n```\ncurl -s -x socks5h://relay.8333.space:8882 https://nprofile1qqs8a8nk09fhrxylcd42haz8ev4cprhnk5egntvs0whafvaaxpk8plgpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuwpnxvejuumsv93k2g6k9kr/v1/info --insecure | jq\n```\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTMl.png \n\nI can't stress this enough: THE MINT RUNS BEHIND HTTPS!\n\nThe NWS entry relay can't read your traffic. It's encrypted. We can host public entry relays that can be used by anyone.\n\nThis means we can plug the entire internet to it üåê.\n\nLet's plug it into Cashu for now. Nutshell wallet supports socks5 proxies (that's how it uses Tor). By setting the public entry relay as the proxy, the wallet can now connect to a mint's npub/nprofile and communicate with it via NWS.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTot.png \n\nThis is going to be so freaking cool. And it's going to be a lot more useful than just for Cashu. There are still bugs and issues that need to be ironed out but the code is coming out soon. Watch this space.",

    "content": "#dev #CLN\n\nI've spent the last few workdays completely reworking our onion message code.  This was scattered in various places and I wanted to unify it, and also written several years ago and I'd forgotten how the protocol actually works!\n\nonion messages are *double* encrypted; this is the main source of confusion!  At the high layer, they're a series of nested encrypted calls (\"onionmsg_tlv\" in the BOLT 4 spec), so each recipient decrypts and hands it on: this is exactly the same as we use for payment information.  But inside that is *another* encrypted blob (onionmsg_tlv.encrypted_recipient_data), which requires a tweak which was handed to you alongside the onion, for you to decrypt (into an \"encrypted_data_tlv\").  Inside that is all the information about where to send next, any restrictions, and allows you to calculate the *next* tweak to hand on (it can also override the next tweak).\n\nThe double encryption is necessary because there are *three* actors here: Alice wants Bob to send her a message, without revealing her identity. So she gives Bob a \"blinded path\" which goes via Charlie: this path contains Charlie's pubkey (where to start the path), a blinding tweak, and two encrypted blobs for Alice to put into each layer of the onion message.  The first an encrypted blob which Charlie can read, which contains her pubkey so he knows where to send it next.  The second is her own, and contains a secret specific to the purpose of this message, so Bob can't play games trying to use this blinded path for anything else (\"hey, are you the same node as this previous payment?\") or use a different blinded path for this purpose.  She can also add dummy hops (we don't yet), which she will simply absorb, to obscure the path length from Bob.  You can add padding to make the hops indistinguishable (we don't yet).\n\nBob puts the actual stuff he wants to send Alice into the final onion call (often including his own blinded reply path!), along with the encrypted blob.\n\nImportantly, even if Bob were sending a message *not through a blinded path* he would use the same double-encrypted format: that's so Charlie can't tell whether a blinded path is being used or not, even though it's slightly less efficient.  Crypto is cheap these days, too.\n\nNow, if Alice gives Bob a blinded path to Charlie and Charlie is Bob's peer, he can simply send the onion and the first blinding tweak to Charlie.  But if Alice needs to send the message via Dave to Charlie, she needs to prepend a step.  That's not quite possible, naively, because blinding tweaks are generated *forwards*, and she needs Charlie to get the right blinding tweak from Dave, and Alice has no way of making that happen.  So inside Dave's encrypted blob, she uses next_blinding_override to tell Dave to hand that blinding override to Charlie instead of the normal one.  I just implemented this for Core Lightning (previously we would simply connect to the first node, which is privacy-compromising and should only be done as a last resort).\n\nThese blinded paths have some nice properties: you can't use part of them (you don't know the blinding factor except for the first one, so you can't start in the middle, and you can't replace any data), you need to use all of them.  They can contain timelimits to avoid easy probing, too: a classic measure would be to see if the path fails when a given node is down, but that takes time.  The spec insists all errors within the blinded path are the same, and originate from the entry: this loses some analytical power on failure, but makes probing harder.  The entry point is supposed to add a random delay (we don't yet!).  There may still be implementation differences, but they're hard for Bob to probe (and Alice doesn't need to, as she set up the path).\n",
