It means not participating in any activity proposed by the state, in any of its forms.\n\nSamuel Edward Konkin III, known as SEK3, (July 8, 1947 - February 23, 2004) was an American libertarian philosopher, author of the ‚ÄúNew Libertarian Manifesto‚Äù, proponent of the political philosophy he called Agorism, a revolutionary form of Anarchism, not founded on political actions but on Counter-economics. He was influenced by Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre, and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nFrom the Greek agora, meaning market.\n\nAustrian economics has as its main concept the valuation of goods and services, therefore demand is inherent to each person, who does it subjectively.\n\nSubjectively we value some goods or services more than others, while others value in the opposite sense. When we trade we do not give up a value, but acquire a higher value.\n\nThe utility we obtain is marginal, i.e. we value each new acquisition differently.\n\nùöÖùöäùöïùöûùöé ùöíùöú ùöúùöûùöãùöìùöéùöåùöùùöíùöüùöé.\n\nThis simple revelation, formulated by Carl Menger (Von Mises‚Äô teacher), revolutionized primitive economics and solved most of the problems that had plagued the science since Adam Smith. If Marx had paid attention to Menger, communism would have been abandoned.\n\nùöÇùöûùöãùöìùöéùöåùöùùöíùöüùöé ùöüùöäùöïùöûùöé ùöïùöéùöäùöçùöú ùöùùöò ùöíùöóùöçùöíùöüùöíùöçùöûùöäùöïùöíùöúùöñ.\n\nGovernment is force, however legitimate and accepted it may be. All force prevents the voluntary satisfaction of subjective values. Any violence that deters or forces exchanges is counter-productive to an organic, healthy development of the economy.\n\nùöÉùöëùöé ùöüùöòùöïùöûùöóùöùùöäùöõùö¢ ùöèùöõùöéùöé ùöñùöäùöõùöîùöéùöù ùöíùöú ùöùùöëùöé ùöôùöûùöõùöúùöûùöíùöù ùöòùöè ùô∞ùöêùöòùöõùöíùöúùöñ.\n\nCoercion is immoral, inefficient, and unnecessary for leading a satisfying life.  \n\nTo combat coercion, one must understand it. Although the market can develop a defense to the state‚Äôs attack, it is slower. The optimal way to control coercion is through immediate, individual self-defense, Agorism.\n\nùêìùê°ùêû ùêíùê≠ùêöùê≠ùêû ùêàùê¨ ùêéùêÆùê´ ùêÑùêßùêûùê¶ùê≤\n\nAll actions of the State are incremental over time. The centralized government structure never tends to shrink, on the contrary, it tends to increase in size, with greater interference over individuals.\n\nThe State with its coercive regulations acts on the economy, making predictions about the consequences of this or that measure implemented in order to estimate with precision, something that is more typical of soothsayers than of scientists, knowing that there are always unpredictable collateral effects, which will require more regulations.\n\nAs I said, the State tends to increase its interference in the market.\n\nThis is free market competition or state monopoly.  \n\nThe centralized planning of this monopoly authority is another farce. The statists would have us believe that without social and economic organization and engineering, the world would be in chaos. The world is already chaos thanks to such central planning, you can see that. You might think that without the rulers it would be worse, but how do you know?\n\nCounter-economics is that immediate and individual defense, of which you can predict with certainty, since individual actions have direct impact between the action and its consequences. Counter-economics offers immediate gratification to those who abandon state restraint.\n\nThe term Counter-economics was formed in the same way as the term ‚ÄúCounter-culture,‚Äù the practice of human acts that seek to evade and challenge the impositions of the State.\n\nThe equation is more State, more collectivism and less individual. By practical definition, the State is socialist, it cannot be individualist.  \n\nThere are different degrees of statist models of government, but at its core is the tendency to populism as the central axis for retaining power. If it fails to concentrate enough power, the next phase is dictatorship, the highest degree of statism.\n\nThe narrative of the politicians who manage the state apparatus is that they seek the common welfare, beyond individuals, i.e. the collective over the individual.\n\nSince each person has his or her own scheme of satisfaction, it is impossible for central policies to satisfy everyone, either because they do not know what the needs of each one are, or because they override them for some and give them to others.\n\nùêÄùê†ùê®ùê´ùê¢ùê¨ùê≠ ùêèùê´ùê¢ùêßùêúùê¢ùê©ùê•ùêûùê¨\n\nAgorism is action and counter-economics is the way to act individually.\n\nAgorism seeks to protect private property and individual freedom.\n\nIts fundamental principle is to exchange risk for benefit; the risk of being fined or imprisoned by the central authority, and the benefit of evading taxation.  \n\nBoth risk and benefit have economic implications, but also social implications in some cases. The greater the expected benefit, the greater the risk that can be assumed.\n\nThe second principle is that of non-aggression, where all action is exercised without violence, (so as not to act like the statists), unless it is used in self-defense. The Agorist does not initiate violence, but continues it to avoid being harmed.\n\nIn an Agorist society, the division of labor and the self-respect of each worker and each capitalist-entrepreneur would probably eliminate the traditional business organization, especially the business hierarchy, an imitation of the State and not the market. Most companies will be associations of independent contractors, consultants, and other businesses.\n\nIn that sense decentralization, which is another guiding principle, goes very well with crypto-economics, an innovative technological development.  \n\nReality is our standard. Nature is our legislator. Agorism is an ideology, but it is also a scientific and definitely materialistic way of thinking.\n\nThus, Agorism is founded on the study of the logical and conscious structure of human action, praxeology, which produced some respectable observations that deserve the title of scientific law.\n\nIn fact, human action produces rules, which emerge as necessary for social and economic relations, but emanate from a consensus of parties and not from an authoritarian and centralized imposition, like regulations.\n\nùêìùê°ùêû ùêëùê®ùêöùêù ùêìùê® ùêìùê°ùêû ùêÄùê†ùê®ùê´ùêö\n\nThe State now has its power dome, to a greater or lesser degree, but in all countries it is like that.  \n\nThe more people reject the mystifications of the State - nationalism, economic planning, political promises of general welfare - the more the Counter-economy will grow both vertically (new structures such as companies and services) and horizontally, more people diverting more and more of their activity towards the Counter-economy.\n\nùöä¬≥ : ùöäùöåùöùùöíùöòùöó, ùöäùöêùöòùöõùöä, ùöäùöóùöäùöõùöåùöëùö¢\n\nState-controlled fiat money is a crucial tool in the manipulative economic design. Based on debt and not on wealth, the uncontrolled issuance, the increase or reduction of the cost of money (interest rates) and the distribution of the discretionary monetary base via commercial banks, constitute the financial power of the statists.  \n\nThus the separation of money from the clutches of the State becomes necessary, and today we have the possibility of making it a reality with cryptocurrencies, which are based on blockchain technology, with monetary designs for all tastes and market needs, thus forming a free supply of money with voluntary demand.\n\nAgorism is an individual decision that is intertwined ‚Äúsubway‚Äù, subtle and voluntary, and spreads in society organically, as a natural force, sought to preserve private property and freedom.\n\nMost (if not all) people practice Agorism to varying degrees, even statists who claim to advocate planned economics.\n\nIt is natural for people, in their instinct of defense, to want to preserve their property from state-imposed plunder.\n\nIt is impossible to comply with all the impositions of the State at all times and in all its forms, since there are so many laws and so perverse that it is unfeasible, even masochistic...\nùòûùò¶ ùò¢ùò≥ùò¶ ùò¢ùò≠ùò≠ ùòàùò®ùò∞ùò≥ùò™ùò¥ùòµùò¥, ùòµùò∞ ùò¥ùò∞ùòÆùò¶ ùò¶ùòπùòµùò¶ùòØùòµ ùò¢ùòØùò• ùò¢ùòµ ùò¥ùò∞ùòÆùò¶ ùò±ùò∞ùò™ùòØùòµ ùò™ùòØ ùò≠ùò™ùòßùò¶, ùò∞ùòØùò≠ùò∫ ùò¥ùò∞ùòÆùò¶ ùò•ùò∞ ùòØùò∞ùòµ ùò¨ùòØùò∞ùò∏ ùò™ùòµ.\n\n#tags: LiberLion Article #Agorism\n",

Paid a 100k sats Lightning invoice from two different Cashu mints at the same time.\n\nEnter atomic multinut payments.\n\nhttps://video.nostr.build/935d5c453c00ae7498be116b9c4d4b358d326854fd7cf19ebfa782f69a575a6c.mp4\n\nAll Cashu wallets let you use multiple mints. To reduce rug risk, we encourage users to leave only small amounts on each mint. This introduces a big UX challenge which forces users to distribute funds on different mints in a smart way. It's particularly problematic when you're trying to pay a bigger Lightning invoice from your small balances. Who has time for that?\n\nThe Lightning protocol allows nodes to split a single payment HTLC into multiple parts to increase the chance of reaching the destination, called Multi-Path Payments (MPP). Typically, that's done from one sender to one receiver. What if... you can just break the rules? \n\nA multinut payment originates from multiple Lightning nodes to pay a single invoice, atomically. Even if none of your mint balances can cover an invoice, as long as your total balance is large enough, you can pay the invoice.\n\nI don't think anyone was crazy enough to do this before.

This significantly reduces transaction costs per user and greatly enhances scalability.\n\nThe protocol mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs familiar UTXO structure using Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs). These offchain abstractions preserve a familiar output ownership model while embedding many claims into a single Batch Output. VTXOs ensure that users retain unilateral control over their funds and enable efficient offchain coordination before final settlement on Bitcoin.\n\nLink for details! \n\nüëæ\n\n",

    "content": "In the context of cryptographic signing (like in Nostr), **round-tripping** refers to the ability to serialize a data structure (e.g., JSON) into a string, then deserialize it back into an identical data structure **without any changes to formatting, key ordering, whitespace, or other non-semantic details**. \n\nThe problem arises because many JSON libraries/implementations handle serialization differently (e.g., adding/removing spaces, reordering keys, varying number representations). If a protocol like Nostr requires signing a JSON string, but doesn‚Äôt enforce **strict ECMA-262 serialization rules**, two implementations might produce *different string representations* of the *same logical data*, leading to **failed signature verifications**. \n\nFor example:\n1. Implementation A serializes `{\"a\":1,\"b\":2}` with spaces: `{ \"a\": 1, \"b\": 2 }`\n2. Implementation B serializes the same object with no spaces and reversed keys: `{\"b\":2,\"a\":1}`\n3. The resulting strings differ ‚Üí hashes differ ‚Üí signatures mismatch, even though the data is \"logically\" identical.\n\nThis is why the Nostr ecosystem has faced interoperability issues ‚Äì its original spec naively assumed JSON implementations would naturally agree on serialization details, which they don‚Äôt. Crypto protocols *must* standardize serialization rigorously (as ECMA-262 does) to avoid these round-tripping pitfalls.",

When they first went missing, we revoked their repository access as a precaution. We soon learned their disappearance was completely unrelated to GrapheneOS. Our priority has been keeping them safe.\n\nWe've used our available connections to try to keep them safe. There's no way to get them out of the conscription. However, they're an incredibly talented security researcher and engineer and it would be extraordinarily misguided to send them to front line combat. This seems to be understood now.\n\nGrapheneOS development and updates have continued and will keep going. We have substantial funds available to hire multiple experienced developers. We'll need to hire multiple experienced developers to fill their big shoes. They'll hopefully be safe and when they return we'll have a bigger team.\n\nIf you're an experienced AOSP developer interested in working full time on GrapheneOS in a fully remote position, see the hiring page at:\n\nhttps://grapheneos.org/hiring \n\nWe can pay people anywhere in the world via BTC, XMR, ETH or Wise (local bank transfers). We need people who can hit the ground running due to the current situation.\n\nOur near term focus is going to heavily shift to Android 16 porting, maintenance and continuing to do better patching than standard Android 15 QPR2.

With that said I'm sure I would never have any difficulty to obtain simple blank hides with natural color and no finish. The problem arise when you start looking for finished hides.\nhttps://image.nostr.build/84e44a2835e733c4a663f2ca57414fefeb06071504bd9e5cdfbbbd79c7a0ab73.jpg\nEach tannery have their own technique to obtain their finish. Badalassi Carlo has this beautiful pueblo I use a lot. A very distinct look. But they have only one tannery to supply the entire world. There's many suppliers around the world that has stocks so if you really want a hide you can find one but your favorite supplier who can satisfy your thickness desire might often run out and the supply chain is not as fast as Amazon. I'm currently stuck waiting a month to get my hands on tabacco pueblo. But the REAL scarcity is found in shell cordovan.\nhttps://image.nostr.build/d1663d3311c655368eed6d49672984ea6d4758eb2909de8528ab9bb0bc265f86.jpg\nShell cordovan is a rare, high-end leather made from a small, dense layer of fibrous tissue found in the rump of a horse. My favorite one is the Japanese shinki-hikaku. The process take from 6 to 10 months. There is only a couple handful of hides available in any given color. They are very difficult to obtain reliably and are all sold individually. You buy a specific hide. There is an orange one at my main supplier. Only 1 left out of 3. I haven't found anywhere else I can get it. Maybe it's possible to get it elsewhere, but I haven't found it.\nhttps://image.nostr.build/cd2973d63503669779fb75d460e2299a41e05ec85dfede2a8eb78b5a957cfe4d.jpg\n\nNote that this is my experience as a small retail.

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

They would very much prefer a system of taxation that cannot be hidden from. \n\nThat‚Äôs where the term ‚Äòdaylight robbery‚Äô comes from. Back in England, there was [this idea) that ‚Äòthe home is the castle,‚Äô and the tax man did not have the legal authority to enter the house and see the amount of wealth that you have inside, like how many gold coins does the subject have available. That was not allowed by law. It was a rather private system. So the solution was to tax what was visible. So the tax rate that you had to pay as a subject was dependent on the number and size of windows in your house, because that was something the taxman could see from the outside. You could not hide the number of windows that you have. And so the obvious protection mechanism unfortunately was to decrease the size and quantity of your windows. So a lot of old houses have their windows laid full of bricks to decrease the tax burden of individuals. So this was why we call taxation ‚Äòdaylight robbery‚Äô ‚Äî because it literally robbed the daylight of honest people.\n\nPrivacy benefits the victim, and surveillance benefits the attacker. And so if we create systems that are used widely by people and that have privacy as a default, then all of a sudden we substantially increase the cost of attack for any type of adversary. And if we create tools and software that have this default utilization of privacy at a cheap rate, then we decrease the cost of defense. I believe that‚Äôs the closest path to world peace, so to say ‚Äî it‚Äôs a cypherpunk world where privacy is safeguarded and any attack is simply not profitable.‚Äù\n\n@npub1klkk3vrzme455yh9rl2jshq7rc8dpegj3ndf82c3ks2sk40dxt7qulx3vt / Ep.32 / 53:04\n\n\nhttps://i.nostr.build/sLRwz5tKDOpfBHpD.png",

    "content": "Axiom of Resistance\n\nIn modern logic an axiom is a premise, it cannot be proven. It is a starting assumption against which other things may be proven. For example, in Euclidean geometry one cannot prove that parallel lines never meet. It simply defines the particular geometry. Proving statements about Bitcoin requires reliance on axiomatic systems, specifically mathematics, probability and catallactics, and therefore the assumptions upon which they rely. \n\nHowever Bitcoin also relies on an axiom not found in these systems. Satoshi alludes to this in an early statement: In other words, there is an assumption that it is possible for a system to resist state control. This is not accepted as a fact but deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to the behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system. \n\n\"You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.  Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.  Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" Satoshi Thu Nov 6 15:15:40 EST 2008\n\nIn other words, there is an assumption that it is possible for a system to resist state control. This is not accepted as a fact but deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to the behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.\n\nOne who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an entirely different system than Bitcoin. If one assumes it is not possible for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not make sense in the context of Bitcoin ‚Äì just as conclusions in spherical geometry contradict Euclidean. How can Bitcoin be permissionless or censorship resistant without the axiom? \n\nThe contradiction leads one to make obvious errors in an attempt to rationalize the conflict. It is common for people to refer cynically to a Bitcoin-like system that omits the resistance axiom as ‚Äújust another PayPal‚Äù, a designation not without merit. Confinity originally attempted to create a system with a similar value proposition to Bitcoin. Having failed to do so it discarded the axiom, building the PayPal we know today.\n\n\nnostr:nevent1qqsguashckakpyuey5933hzy35z5xx0pqsd99e0xkq4mn69vyuh38kqpzdmhxue69uhhwmm59e6hg7r09ehkuef0qgst0mtgkp3du662ztj3l4fgts0purksu5fgek5n4vgmg9gt2hkn9lqrqsqqqqqpr86cyv",

    "content": "Our latest 2025032500 release greatly improved our built-in network-based location. It's usually better than Google's network-based location in urban areas where Apple has competitive data. Unlike Google's service, position estimation is done locally by fetching location data for nearby networks.\n\nYou can enable this feature via the toggle we added at Settings > Location > Location services > Network location. You can optionally enable the standard Wi-Fi scanning toggle in the Location services menu to allow Wi-Fi scans when Wi-Fi is otherwise disabled to keep network-based location working.\n\nOur implementation is currently based entirely on Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). Location data for nearby APs is fetched in batches from either Apple's service or a GrapheneOS proxy server. We also ask the service for up to 100 nearby APs which it provides with a reasonable density over a large area.\n\nOur implementation caches location data for up to 10000 APs in an in-memory Least-Recently-Used cache with 15 minute expiry after last usage of an AP. This avoids persisting a local location history while enabling semi-offline usage. We can make these parameters user configurable in the future.\n\nMost navigation apps use the fused location service providing the best result from GNSS (GPS, Galileo, etc.) or network-based location (when it's enabled). Other apps often prefer network-based location for lower power usage and quicker results not requiring GNSS reception. Some apps can't use GNSS.\n\nMost apps on the Play Store use the Google Play services location service instead of the OS provided location service. By default, our sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer reroutes location requests from these apps to the OS location service so there's no need to give Location to Play services.\n\nNearly all users on Google Mobile Services devices have their network-based location enabled. This means some apps assume it's always available. For improved compatibility, our default enabled rerouting emulates the presence of network location with GNSS when the OS network location service is off.\n\nIn the near future, we'll be making several major improvements to our network location service including Wi-Fi RTT (Round-Trip-Time) for improved distance estimation and cell tower fallback to make it work better outside cities. There will also be a lot more efficiency and other improvements to it.\n\nLonger term, we'll be providing our own location service rather than only a proxy along with full offline support via database downloads. It already works offline for a while based on the cache. We'll be using data from Apple's service to bootstrap our service, but we'll also be using other sources.\n\nSource code is available here:  \n\nhttps://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_NetworkLocation\n\nIt's new code and still being built out so it hasn't had much refactoring, optimization or tuning yet. It's a mix of Kotlin and Rust since we wrote position estimation in Rust for significantly better performance.\n\n#GrapheneOS",

    "content": "This is a really important discussion and I have so many thoughts that hopefully I can put together..  \nWhat has the state traditionally done to take out an adversary? Cut off their supply lines (whether its a mobile army or with a siege), completely wiped out their sources of sustenance (see the plains native Americans and the buffalo), or via control of centralized food systems (mostly under communism so far). \n\nThe physical realm is much overlooked by bitcoiners IMO. We should all be growing at least a portion of our food and not be completely reliant on centralized food systems. \nCommunity and networks of resilience are key- these days that is typically via farmers markets and local co-ops. Barter is already commonplace at the markets we attend. \n\nBut the main thing is acquiring skills that can be used and applied anywhere if mobility is required. We all have our intrinsic areas of interest and skill, so finding like minded folks with other specialties and skillsets is key. \n\nBeing your own first responder and doctor is becoming more and more important with skyrocketing costs and \"care\" that often does more harm than good in hospitals/clinics. \n\nBasic building skills, the ability to fix things, tinker and creatively problem solve will all be superpowers in a world that slowly becomes more tech and AI dependent. \n\nLast thing is raising free range, slightly wild children that are outside the state's grasp. This is probably my most important job right now apart from providing fiat for the family. \n\nThe overall goal is building parallel systems that make the old ones obsolete since they are intrinsically better, provide more value, community, security and resilience. \n\nThere was a bunch more I thought of but can't remember- hopefully there is some food for thought there.

It can operate even with very high latency and extremely low bandwidth. Reticulum allows you to build wide-area networks with off-the-shelf tools, and offers end-to-end encryption and connectivity, initiator anonymity, autoconfiguring cryptographically backed multi-hop transport, efficient addressing, unforgeable delivery acknowledgements and more.\n\nThe vision of Reticulum is to allow anyone to be their own network operator, and to make it cheap and easy to cover vast areas with a myriad of independent, inter-connectable and autonomous networks. Reticulum is not one network. It is a tool for building thousands of networks. Networks without kill-switches, surveillance, censorship and control. Networks that can freely interoperate, associate and disassociate with each other, and require no central oversight. Networks for human beings. Networks for the people.\n\nReticulum is a complete networking stack, and does not rely on IP or higher layers, but it is possible to use IP as the underlying carrier for Reticulum. It is therefore trivial to tunnel Reticulum over the Internet or private IP networks.\n\nHaving no dependencies on traditional networking stacks frees up overhead that has been used to implement a networking stack built directly on cryptographic principles, allowing resilience and stable functionality, even in open and trustless networks.\n\nNo kernel modules or drivers are required. Reticulum runs completely in userland, and can run on practically any system that runs Python 3.",

    "content": "Currency reforms and CBDCs\n\nCzechoslovakia ‚Äì Currency Reform of 1953\nIn Czechoslovakia, a drastic currency reform took place in May 1953 under the communist regime. Old crowns were replaced with new ones at a rate of 5:1 for savings up to 5,000 Kƒçs, but for higher amounts, the rate was far less favorable, up to 50:1. Key aspect: Citizens could exchange only a limited amount of money, and if they wanted to exchange more, they had to document the legal origin of their income, which was practically impossible, especially for private entrepreneurs or people with savings. Many thus lost most of their wealth, leading to widespread impoverishment.\nGermany ‚Äì Currency Reform of 1948\nAfter World War II, in West Germany, a reform in June 1948 replaced the Reichsmark with the new Deutsche Mark. Each resident could exchange only 40 Reichsmarks per person at a 1:1 rate, with the rest of their savings frozen and later partially devalued at a 10:1 rate. Key aspect: The restriction to a fixed amount (40 DM per person) and the need to document income for larger sums meant that those with greater savings (often from the black market or pre-war times) lost most of their wealth. While the reform jumpstarted the economy, it was devastating for many.\nUSA ‚Äì Nixon Shock of 1971\nIn August 1971, President Nixon ended the gold standard, decoupling the dollar from gold. This wasn‚Äôt a traditional currency exchange, but it devalued money through inflation and eroded purchasing power. Key aspect: While there was no direct requirement to document income or limit exchanges, the indirect consequences‚Äîloss of trust in the dollar and subsequent inflation‚Äîimpoverished residents, especially those holding cash savings. Control over the currency shifted entirely to the state and central bank.\nCBDC (Digital Euro) and Similarities to These Reforms\nThe digital euro, as a form of central bank digital currency (CBDC), presents a modern parallel to these historical reforms, particularly in terms of control and restrictions. With a CBDC, the central bank (in this case, the ECB) would have direct oversight over every transaction. If it were introduced with rules such as a maximum amount an individual could hold or exchange, or a requirement to document the origin of funds (e.g., when converting cash to digital currency), it would echo past restrictions.\nSpecifically:\nNeed to document income: When introducing a CBDC, governments might require citizens to prove the legality of their savings during the conversion from cash to digital currency, much like in Czechoslovakia or Germany. This could disadvantage people with informal income or savings.\nLimit on amounts: The ECB could impose caps on holding digital euros (e.g., to combat money laundering), replicating the fixed-sum principle of the German reform.\nLoss of anonymity: Unlike cash, every transaction would be traceable, increasing the risk of retroactive controls and penalties, thus amplifying state power over individuals‚Äîa centralization similar to that seen in the Nixon Shock.\n\nThe digital euro could resemble these reforms by potentially limiting individuals‚Äô freedom to manage their own money and imposing strict rules, such as the need to document income or caps on exchange amounts. Historically, such measures led to impoverishment, and a CBDC could repeat this problem in the digital age, this time with even greater control over the population.\n\nBuy Bitcoin, now.

Anarchy is not a political system, a society, or a geographical entity‚Äîit‚Äôs a #protocol by which human beings interact without unjustified force. You should look for it everywhere, and you‚Äôll easily find it!\n\nJust consider how music has evolved, how foods and recipes have been created, how mathematics has advanced through individual contributions, or even the history of #Bitcoin 's whitepaper. These are all examples of anarchy‚Äîvoluntary, self-regulated, and decentralized coordination. Anarchy has existed in nearly everything we enjoy!\n\n#grownostr",

Grind them slow in a powerful blender, with glass container ideally. Use the wooden spoon the help the mass to the knives. Add MCT by spoons, probably 3-5 tableapoons per 400g of nuts.\n\nIngredients: raw cocoa, MCT oil (pure C8), seasalt without added iodine, cashews or peanuts, a bit of erythritol in the cocoa version.\n\nStep 3 will be my home-made NO BS Reese cups.

    "content": "A Trusted Nostr npub: The Intersection of Self-Validating Data and Socially-Verified Claims\n\nIn Nostr, a trusted npub (public key) is built on two distinct but complementary components:\n\t1.\tSelf-validating data ‚Äì Cryptographically provable facts that require no external trust.\n\t2.\tSocially-verified claims ‚Äì Assertions about identity, reputation, or key possession that rely on external trust and can go out of date.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction is crucial to how trust is established and maintained in decentralized systems.\n\nSelf-Validating Data: Always Provable, Always Valid\n\nSelf-validating data is mathematically contained and can be verified at any time without requiring an external authority.\n\nFor example:\n\t‚Ä¢\tA Nostr event is valid if its cryptographic signature correctly matches the npub.\n\t‚Ä¢\tA message signed with a private key is valid as long as the signature is intact.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe same message will always validate in the future, no matter when it is checked.\n\nThis property makes self-validating data timeless‚Äîit does not degrade or depend on external context.\n\nSocially-Verified Claims: Trust Requires Timeliness\n\nSocially-verified claims, on the other hand, are context-dependent and can become outdated over time.\n\nFor example:\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúThis npub belongs to Alice.‚Äù This claim might be true today, but how do we know Alice still controls the private key tomorrow?\n\t‚Ä¢\tPossession of a private key (nsec) is a socially-verified claim. While signing a message proves possession at the moment of signing, that proof becomes stale over time. The key could be lost, stolen, or compromised, and observers must rely on recent confirmation to continue trusting it.\n\nVerification of a socially-verified claim happens at a specific point in time‚Äîbut since time moves forward, the claim is always slightly out of date. This time delta means verification inherently involves some level of trust.\n\nThe Key Insight: Validation is Timeless, Verification is Temporary\n\t‚Ä¢\tValidation (self-validating data) can be done at any time and remains true forever.\n\t‚Ä¢\tVerification (socially-verified claims) must be done in the present but will always be slightly outdated.\n\nThis means that trust in an npub requires both:\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe ability to validate cryptographic proofs whenever needed.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe willingness to accept slightly outdated verification based on social consensus.\n\nThe Challenge of Long-Term Trust in Nostr\n\nBecause socially-verified claims go out of date, maintaining trust in an npub requires:\n\t‚Ä¢\tRecurrent verification ‚Äì Users must periodically check if the npub is still actively controlled by the same entity.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRedundancy ‚Äì Multiple signatures or alternate verification mechanisms can reduce reliance on any single moment of verification.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAwareness of revocation risks ‚Äì Just because an npub was trusted yesterday does not mean it is safe today.\n\nConclusion: Trust is a Moving Target\n\nA trusted npub is never fully trusted forever‚Äîit is a balance between self-validating cryptographic proof (which never expires) and socially-verified claims (which require continuous updating). The reality of decentralized trust is that while validation is deterministic and timeless, verification is a social process that degrades over time and must be continuously renewed.",

    "content": "March security bulletin lists 2 vulnerabilities as actively exploited in the wild:\n\nhttps://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-03-01\n\nCVE-2024-43093 patch was in Android 15 QPR1 released in December. It's just being backported now.\n\nCVE-2024-50302 doesn't impact GrapheneOS due to our exploit protections.\n\nAndroid Security Bulletins are very commonly misinterpreted as being Android's monthly security patches. They're actually backports of most High and Critical severity patches to older releases of Android: 12, 12L, 13, 14 and 15. Yes, Android 15 is an older release of Android.\n\nCVE-2024-50302 is one of 3 vulnerabilities which Amnesty International recently found being exploited by Cellebrite. This one was fully eliminated as a bug in GrapheneOS through zeroing. Separately from that, our USB-C port control blocked reaching any of the 3 bugs while locked.\n\nFor more details on the 3 Linux kernel USB bugs exploited by Cellebrite, see the previous thread on the socials. #GrapheneOS blocked reaching all 3 while locked at both a hardware and software level, eliminated one and made the other 2 much harder to exploit even when unlocked.\n\nThey included one in the February security bulletin, another this month and still need to add CVE-2024-53197. We patched all 3 earlier via the kernel.org LTS revisions. Our exploit protections blocking exploiting them prior to patching is the far bigger difference.\n\nMarch security bulletin lists 9 Critical severity Bluetooth vulnerabilities caused by use-after-free bugs. Our hardened_malloc project provides strong protections against exploiting these, especially on Pixel 8 and later where it has very good hardware memory tagging integration.\n\nWhen a memory allocation of 128kiB or below is freed on GrapheneOS, memory tagging gives it a dedicated tag detecting any invalid access. It goes through a random quarantine and first-in-first-out quarantine before reuse. First reuse is guaranteed to use a different random tag.\n\nMemory tagging also zeroes the allocation. On devices without it, we still zero it at free time and then check for the zeroing at allocation time to detect write-after-free and guarantee that fresh allocations are zeroed. With memory tagging, it detects the invalid accesses.\n\nAfter a memory allocation is freed, goes through both quarantines, is allocated again, freed again, goes through both quarantines and is allocated again there's still a 14/15 chance for the random tag to detect an invalid memory access. Attackers also usually need to chain bugs.\n\nGrapheneOS users have been regularly finding obscure Bluetooth memory corruption bugs with specific accessories. We generate user-facing notifications for MTE detecting invalid accesses for users to report to us and app devs. We can likely close several more of those issues now.\n\nWe've actually had these Critical severity Bluetooth patches backported for a month already:\n\nhttps://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_modules_Bluetooth/commits/69d9332c8d7097ecece3b94bcd506739e4e5a54b/\n\nGood news is that we've already had those patches for a month. Bad news is it's not the reason for the remaining issues being caught by MTE, will need more work.\n\n\"Fix UAF in sdp_discovery.cc\" patch was included upstream previously, it's just a backport. The others we applied ourselves last month. They weren't listed in the bulletin or included in the monthly update but they were published and they did fix some issues we'd caught with MTE.\n\nnostr:nevent1qqszrwjpzt7fmsm6c44l8av8z27q7g3gl24m2w2583ntsjg8znnngvcpz4mhxue69uhkummnw3ezummcw3ezuer9wchsyg9e3hk5e6h2ypusm09ncv2qq6fqp8f5clueylpgdq66nxm5sxjuygpsgqqqqqqsqe56vq",

    "content": "Amnesty International‚Äôs Security Lab has a post about 3 vulnerabilities exploited by Cellebrite to extract data from locked Android devices. #GrapheneOS blocked exploiting these vulnerabilities in multiple different ways. We also patched them much earlier.\n\nhttps://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2025/02/cellebrite-zero-day-exploit-used-to-target-phone-of-serbian-student-activist/\n\nEach of these is an upstream Linux kernel vulnerability:\n\n* CVE-2024-53104: heap overflow in a Linux kernel USB webcam driver\n* CVE-2024-53197: heap overflow in a Linux kernel USB sound card driver\n* CVE-2024-50302: uninitialized heap memory in a Linux kernel USB touchpad driver\n\nGrapheneOS blocks reaching any of these vulnerabilities for locked devices through our USB-C port and pogo pins control feature disabling new connections at a hardware level and a software level after locking along with disabling USB data in hardware too:\n\nhttps://grapheneos.org/features#usb-c-port-and-pogo-pins-control\n\nCVE-2024-50302 is benign on GrapheneOS. For both the kernel and the rest of the OS, we use the combination of use zero-on-free and either zero-on-allocate or a write-after-free check at allocation time. On devices with hardware memory tagging (MTE), it's done as part of tagging.\n\nCVE-2024-53104 and CVE-2024-53197 are both kernel heap overflows in slab allocations. We provide improved defenses against these attacks in multiple ways covered in the kernel section at https://grapheneos.org/features#exploit-mitigations. Our defenses in userspace are far stronger due to hardened_malloc.\n\nWe recently enabled hardware memory tagging (MTE) for Linux kernel after over a year of deploying it for userspace via hardened_malloc. It provides an approximation of memory safety which can be improved over time. It requires hardware support exclusive to 8th/9th gen Pixels.\n\nGrapheneOS shipped patches for these 3 vulnerabilities significantly before the stock Pixel OS or inclusion in an Android Security Bulletin through shipping the latest Linux kernel GKI LTS releases. However, what really matters is we prevented them being used before discovery.\n\nWe have a recent post at https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/113961075324902277 covering how we've significantly improved our defenses against forensic data extraction since January 2024. It covers a lot more than what we talked about here and we recommend reading it along with our features page covering more.",

After all, Wasabi is just a FOSS software without any source of revenue, and there wasn't a company to pay our salaries anymore. The most resounding alternatives were OpenSats and the HRF grants, and I was suggested to apply to both of them. However, I wanted to avoid asking for money from the HRF, and for that reason, I applied to OpenSats even though I knew that many of the people behind it were not the biggest fans of Wasabi. Anyway, I preferred to ask for help from those who I perceive as part of the community. My application was rejected. Turbolay applied before me but his application was rejected too.\n\nTurbolay then decided to apply for one of the HRF grants and asked me if I was okay with him applying for both of us together as the \"Wasabi team,\" and I agreed. So he did it. It was a mistake; I shouldn't have agreed, but I knew that even though they usually highlight how important privacy is for democracy, they would not support us (maybe they cannot do it, who knows). The application was rejected.\n\nAfter that, Turbolay started looking for a job, and fortunately, he found a non-fiat one! But I cannot avoid feeling that if I had released the Wasabi Silent Payment donation button earlier, he would still be 100% available for Wasabi. Even though Turbolay is still making great contributions, he's a fucking hero, a real one ü´°",

    "content": "Not technically perfect or exact to the topic but want to see a #GrapheneOS device with a secondary display and secure element for hardware wallet functionality. It could just be a phone and a device like a Trezor Safe 5 separately in the same housing. Secondary touchscreen for transactions would be on the back next to camera.\n\nUsers could use their own official wallet app if it's just bundling an existing one but an app oriented around the device would be nice for it. Only disadvantage is that the HWW wouldn't fully be integrated with the OS (good and bad), like duress password wiping the wallet at the same time likely not possible because they should be isolated.\n\nFrom technical aspects the wallet app should support privacy features like coinjoins, stealth addresses. Support for multisig and all the big external HWWs. App needs to be fully compatible with OS security features, unfortunately some still break with MTE. If the HWW and app had Nostr key management then it's a bonus. App developer could choose to bundle self-custodial Lightning. I really like how easy Phoenix is but there is dependence of their infrastructure for transactions.\n\nI'd prefer the UI of neobank apps but less cluttered. All these apps use the same kind of UIs because they work. Cryptocurrencies need the same experience and feel as handling fiat currencies to succeed else \"normies\" don't onboard because their apps are unfamiliar. They don't get treated or developed to be used like currencies most of the time and that's a problem. Treat separate currencies like separate accounts, and the wallets of them like separate virtual cards, and \n\nOther features or details need to be:\n\n- Fast and easy swaps from L1 <-> L2 with support for other assets, purchasing from fiat. Cake does good with swaps.\n\n- Reproducible builds\n\n- Encrypting application data with a secure passphrase (optional).\n\n- Privacy network integration (usually Tor)\n\n- NFC tap-to-pay\n\n- Fast and, I can't stress this enough, easy backups\n\n- Device hardware attestation support, like what we do with Auditor. The app could design to have potential safeguards for attestation failure as an advanced feature.\n\n- Home widgets.\n\n- View-only support\n",

I think your mind is stuck in the account based model and this thinking leads you to false conclusions.\n\nAs nostr:nprofile1qy2hwumn8ghj7erfw36x7tnsw43z7un9d3shjqpq2rv5lskctqxxs2c8rf2zlzc7xx3qpvzs3w4etgemauy9thegr43sa96tzn said, pool redemptions decouple submitted work from redeemed value. The pool won't be able to link these two because eHash tokens can be freely traded before redemption. The value represented by a proof of work share can go through any number of splits, joins, and trades before it is redeemed. How do you disentangle that using IP tracking? You could try, but if there is any significant volume...good luck with that.\n\nBOLT12 and on-chain addresses just add the account aspect back in. This is a strict reduction in privacy for the user. They can certainly choose this option if the pool offers it but in terms of privacy it is better to receive ecash mining rewards and spend it directly. This way all your activities occur within the anonymity set of the ecash mint.\n\nThe ecash model simplifies accounting because the pool no longer needs to track the work of every user that connects to it. Instead, the pool accounts for all shares within a time window and that's it. Instead of maintaining hundreds or thousands of accounts in perpetuity the pool manages one 'account' per hour with a prearranged start and end date. I prefer to think of them as contracts. When the contract end date approaches all the assets (mining shares) and liabilities (eHash tokens) of the contract can be zeroed out and removed from the books. The pool never needs to carry a balance for users that have not met their withdrawal threshold.\n\nThis is a dramatic simplification in accounting because it removes an entire class of liabilities that need to be tracked. The business owner no longer needs to be concerned with unredeemed shares.",

    "content": "I wanted to understand how Bitcoin resonates with the Muslim world and Sharia law, so I explored a bit and wrote this short article. lmk what you think and whether I made any mistakes in the thinking process or understanding.\n\n\n\n---\n\n** IS BITCOIN A SHARIA-COMPLIANT ASSET? **\n\n\nThe question of Bitcoin‚Äôs compliance with Islamic finance principles (Sharia) has sparked some debate among scholars, investors and bitcoin / crypto fans. \n\nThere seems to be no universal consensus, and I'm no Muslim but it seems to me from what I've read that Bitcoin‚Äôs design aligns very well with core Islamic values of transparency, fairness, and resistance to exploitation. \n\nBelow, I explore Bitcoin's Sharia compatibility through the lens of ethics, technology, and practical application.  \n\n---\n\n1. CORE SHARIA PRINCIPLES AND BITCOIN‚ÄôS ARCHITECTURE\n \nIslamic finance prohibits *riba* (interest/usury), *gharar* (excessive uncertainty), and mandates *hifz al-mal* (preservation of wealth). Bitcoin‚Äôs protocol directly addresses these concerns.  \n\nBitcoin‚Äôs code contains no interest mechanisms, making it inherently free from *riba*. Transactions occur peer-to-peer without intermediaries, and mining rewards compensate computational work rather than interest-based returns. This contrasts sharply with fiat systems (or with Proof-of-Stake systems) which rely on fractional reserve banking and debt-driven money creation‚Äîpractices deeply entangled with *riba*.  \n\nThe network‚Äôs deterministic monetary policy‚Äîcapped at 21 million coins, with a transparent issuance schedule‚Äîeliminates the systemic *gharar* inherent in fiat currencies (subject to central bank manipulation) or that of gold (whose supply fluctuates with mining discoveries). Every transaction and circulating coin is publicly verifiable on the blockchain, ensuring contractual clarity and reducing ambiguity.  \n\nAs for wealth preservation, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity and decentralization protect against inflationary devaluation. While its short-term volatility draws criticism, long-term appreciation trends (e.g., compounding growth since 2010) suggest it meets *hifz al-mal* for investors prioritizing durability over stability.  \n\n---\n\n2. SCHOLARLY OPINIONS: DIVERGENCE AND PROGRESS\n \nIslamic scholars remain divided on this topic, but momentum is growing in Bitcoin‚Äôs favor. In 2018, Indonesia‚Äôs National Ulema Council recognized cryptocurrency as a tradable commodity, while Dubai-based scholar Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar declared Bitcoin permissible (*halal*) if treated as an asset rather than currency.  \n\nOthers, like Islamic Finance Guru argue Bitcoin is compliant *if* users avoid interest-bearing services (e.g., crypto lending), mirroring rulings on gold, which is permissible as an asset but forbidden in *riba*-based transactions. Critics, including Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Grand Mufti, reject cryptocurrencies due to volatility and speculative trading. However, this stance conflates Bitcoin‚Äôs *design* with human misuse‚Äîa distinction emphasized by progressive scholars.  \n\n---\n\n3. BITCOIN VS. TRADITIONAL ‚ÄúCOMPLIANT‚Äù ALTERNATIVES\n \nGold-backed assets and Islamic banking products are often touted as Sharia-compliant, but Bitcoin offers distinct advantages. In contrast to gold‚Äôs storage costs and opacity in custodianship, Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain provides a public, auditable ledger. Unlike real estate‚Äîa popular Islamic investment‚ÄîBitcoin democratizes access to scarcity without high entry barriers. Most critically, Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization ensures no central authority can debase it, unlike fiat systems that enable *riba* through interest rate manipulation.  \n\n---\n\n4. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs Sharia compliance hinges on ethical usage. To avoid *riba*, investors must steer clear of interest-bearing platforms like crypto lending services. Speculative practices‚Äîday trading, derivatives, or leverage‚Äîintroduce *gharar* and should be avoided in favor of long-term *HODLing*, which aligns with Islamic wealth preservation principles. Prioritizing Bitcoin‚Äôs original purpose‚Äîa censorship-resistant store of value and medium of exchange‚Äîstrengthens its ethical case.  \n\n---\n\nConclusion: Bitcoin is not inherently *haram* (sinful, prohibited by Quran). Its architecture‚Äîscarce, transparent, and free from centralized manipulation‚Äîresonates deeply with Islamic financial ethics. While misuse (e.g., speculation, *riba* services) can render it non-compliant, the same risks apply to gold or real estate.  \n\nFor Muslims exploring Bitcoin, intentionality is key: use it as a long-term store of value, avoid interest-based platforms. As Islamic finance wakes up to future technology, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a *halal* hedge against fiat injustice will grow.  \n",

    "content": "Phase 0. Waiting. Someone requests that the admin do a signing ceremony, such that each pool member will receive X sats of inbound capacity, where X is picked by the person who made the request (\"the Requester\") and must be below whatever amount the admin has in on-chain bitcoin. The admin's software automatically sets a 30 minute timer and gives the Requester a sharable link for people to join the ceremony. The Requester goes about finding additional people to join the ceremony, and gets to see how many people clicked the link and are waiting. At any point before the 30 minutes are up, the Requester may prompt the admin's software to start the ceremony, and the admin's software will do so as long as the number of people in the room is above a minimum established in their configuration file. If the 30 minutes expire without the Requester starting the ceremony, it aborts.\n\nPhase 1. Admission fee. The admin's software identifies the number of people from phase 0 and calculates an admission fee, based on taking the amount of money to be provided to each as inbound capacity, plus a mining fee divided by however many users there are, and makes a bunch of lightning invoices for the resulting amount. The admin shows this to each person in the signing ceremony. They each have 1 minute to pay. If anyone does not pay, the remaining people are still in there ceremony. If, when the 1 minute is up, the number of people who paid is below a minimum threshold determined in the admin's configuration file, it aborts.\n\nPhase 2. Signing. The admin tells everyone what utxo he will use to fund a multisig composed of every user's pubkey in an n-of-n. Each user independently constructs the funding transaction and all the transactions needed for each user to have a unilateral withdrawal into a channel. The number of signatures which each user must produce is (n**2) + n. Since the number of signatures required is variable, I don't have a static timer; instead, I require each user to send in a batch of data every 10 seconds, and right now I simply require that the number of signatures they've signed so far increases by at least 1. (I should probably raise that to something like 1000.) If anyone fails to send in valid signatures, they are ejected; the admin keeps their money; and he resends the signal to start signing, but only includes the pubkeys who did everything right. So everyone recreates the n-of-n multisig with the new set of pubkeys and starts resigning the funding tx and the unilateral withdrawal transactions. Repeat til everything is signed.\n\nPhase 3. Broadcast. The admin broadcasts the funding transaction, funding the multisig. All of the money is in a state where any user, at any time, can unilaterally withdraw their share into a channel, i.e. a 2 of 2 multisig where the user has a key and the admin has a key. This channel has an initial state whereby all the money is on the admin's side of the channel, thus giving the user maximum inbound capacity. So, if anyone unilaterally withdraws at this stage, the admin will not lose any money; it's all on his side of every channel. The admin also sends every user the set of sigs they need to unilaterally withdraw, and each user validates these signatures before using the channel. Since they know the multisig script, and they validate all the signatures, there is no danger of them being tricked into not having a unilateral exit. But the admin *could* just not send them anything and keep their admission fee, which would constitute theft. So he has to be trusted not to do that, though I imagine admission fees will tend to be small, because that's the point.\n\nPhase 4. Confirmation. Once the funding transaction confirms, it is safe for every user who has validated their withdrawal signatures to use their channel. Although it is not broadcasted yet, each user, as well as the admin, has the signatures necessary to put it on chain at any time. Consequently, they can treat the channel as if it is *already* on-chain. Meaning the user can use it to send and receive lightning payments as well as hedgehog payments, which are asynchronous. I have the admin charge 0 fees to route payments within the pool, which is easy because he has direct channels to each user. I also have him charge 0 fees to route payments to members of any *other* pool that he is the admin for. For payments to other (non-pooled) people, users can use lightning. For on-chain payments, they can use Boltz and competing submarine swap servers. (I will probably eventually have each admin run a submarine swap server too.)",

    "content": "I am designing my implementation with an \"admission fee\" system where the coordinator charges people money to get into the pool. In this design, I think reputation is important. Nothing stops a coordinator from charging 100 people $1 to get into the pool and then running off with the money without ever actually letting them in. In order to allow coordinators to grow a reputation for honesty, I think it is important that they be *pseudonymous,* rather than *anonymous.*\n\nI did think of a way to do the admission fee atomically (i.e. so that users don't pay unless they get into the pool), which would allow for full anonymity because in this alternate model, the coordinator is not even trusted with a single sat. But the way I thought of requires each user to broadcast a base layer transaction in the \"sad path.\"\n\nFor example, if a troll joins the signing ceremony and then refuses to sign anything, that would force each user to use the sad path to recover their admission fee, and thus do a base layer transaction. I suspect a typical base layer mining fee will cost more than $1 in the majority of cases where a coinpool might be desirable, so doing the funding transaction atomically (at least the way I thought of doing it) would give trolls the ability to cause asymmetric misery in a pool of e.g. 100 people. Namely, it would only cost them 1 uneconomical base layer transaction to make 100 people do an uneconomical base layer transaction or lose their money.\n\nI thought that was an unreasonable tradeoff, especially when the admission fee is likely to be a low amount: any coordinator who charges a *large* admission fee is likely to be dispreferred by users, who will likely gravitate toward coordinators with three characteristics: (1) they charge a low admission fee (2) they have a good reputation concerning \"not stealing the admission fee\" (3) they have a good reputation concerning uptime",

There have been many times in human -- and pre-human -- history when the more highly evolved separated themselves from the more primitive, and went their own way -- no longer saddled with the endless drag of lower minds, lower abilities, and the kinds of social structures such types demand. Seen in such a light, those who, today or tomorrow, successfully throw off their fiat/fractional reserve chains may truly represent an evolutionary turning point.",

Surveillance capitalism, government overreach, and the culture of data extraction corrode our ability to live freely, think independently, and interact with trust.\n\nThe future of privacy is no longer something that can be delayed, debated, or dissected. It must be accelerated‚Äînow. The pace of intrusion is relentless; our response must be swifter still. The tools to protect privacy‚Äîencryption, decentralized networks, and privacy-enhancing technologies‚Äîalready exist. But only decisive action can ensure these tools are put into the hands of billions.\n\nWe are not radicals for desiring privacy, but because we understand that privacy is power‚Äîliberation in a world that seeks to control us. Privacy is rebellion. In a society where thoughts, desires, and behaviors are commodified for control, privacy becomes the means by which we reclaim our lives and identities.\n\nThe systems of surveillance‚Äîcorporate, governmental, and societal‚Äîare intertwined, feeding off each other in a symbiotic cycle. But as history shows, even the most entrenched systems are vulnerable to revolution. Cryptography is that revolution. Anonymous transactions, encrypted communications, decentralized data: these are not just theoretical tools but the foundations of a new era.\n\nGovernments and corporations will attempt to stop us, justifying endless data collection with claims of ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù or ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù They will argue privacy is unnecessary in a world where transparency is a virtue. They will say, \"If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.\"\n\nWe reject these premises entirely. Privacy is not about hiding‚Äîit‚Äôs about choice. The choice of what to reveal, to whom, and when. Without privacy, there is no autonomy; without autonomy, there is no freedom. The acceleration of privacy technology is our only path forward.\n\nWe do not oppose technology‚Äîwe champion it. Our fight is against the hijacking of technology to strip away privacy and autonomy. We assert our right to navigate the digital world without the oppressive gaze of surveillance. By embracing technology as a tool for empowerment, we can restore control over personal information to where it belongs‚Äîwith the individual. This is our moral imperative, our stand for a future where freedom and technology coexist.\n\nThe systems of control thrive on complacency and apathy. We are here to disrupt that cycle. We will accelerate the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies‚Äînot as a slow reform, but as a revolution. Code is our weapon, and knowledge our shield. We build not for governments or corporations, but for people. \n\nPrivacy is the cornerstone of an open society in the digital age. To build that society, we will work with cryptographers, developers, activists, and everyday users. We will create networks that resist censorship, tools that ensure anonymity, and communities that defend privacy at all costs.\n\nWe will not wait for permission. We will not apologize for defending our right to exist unobserved. We are not products. We are not data points. We are free individuals.\n\nJoin us, or stand aside. #Privacy will not wait.\n\nOnward.\n\ncontact@privacc.org\nLudlowInstitute.org",

    "content": "Hans-Hermann Hoppe‚Äôs argumentation ethics represents a radical synthesis of logic, ethics, and political theory, asserting that private property rights and the non-aggression principle are not merely pragmatic preferences but *inescapable norms* embedded in the act of rational discourse itself. By engaging in argumentation, participants implicitly accept self-ownership‚Äîthe control of one‚Äôs body and mind‚Äîas a prerequisite for meaningful communication. To deny this principle collapses into performative contradiction: one cannot coherently argue against self-ownership while simultaneously using their body and voice to advance that claim. This transcendental framework extends to property acquisition through homesteading, where mixing labor with unclaimed resources establishes ownership without violating others‚Äô autonomy. Coercive acts like theft or taxation are thereby framed as ethical violations, undermining the very conditions required for dialogue.  \n\nHoppe‚Äôs theory reshaped libertarian thought by anchoring anarcho-capitalism in deontological rigor rather than utilitarian calculation. It positions the state as inherently illegitimate, an institutionalized aggressor that confiscates property and restricts voluntary exchange. By grounding ethics in the irrefutable praxeology of human action‚Äîspecifically, the universal practice of argumentation‚ÄîHoppe challenges opponents to defend coercion without self-refutation. Though polarizing, his work remains a philosophical landmark, merging Austrian economics with Kantian reasoning to assert that liberty is not merely preferable but *logically necessary* for any coherent moral or intellectual exchange. Its legacy lies in forcing both critics and allies to confront the existential link between freedom of speech, property rights, and the possibility of rational discourse itself.",

And anyone who criticizes this is suddenly labeled a leftist. What a Clown Show!** ü§°ü§°ü§°\n\nThe Austrian School of Economics, rooted in the principles of free markets, individualism, and limited government intervention, strongly opposes tariffs as a form of protectionism. Here‚Äôs a concise breakdown of their stance:\n\n1. **Market Distortion**: Tariffs artificially manipulate prices and disrupt the natural price signals that guide efficient resource allocation in a free market. Austrians argue this leads to misallocation of capital and labor, favoring politically connected industries over genuine economic productivity.\n\n2. **Consumer Harm**: By raising prices on imported goods, tariffs reduce purchasing power and limit consumer choice. Austrian thinkers like Ludwig von Mises emphasized that such policies prioritize domestic producers‚Äô interests over the welfare of consumers.\n\n3. **Comparative Advantage**: Following David Ricardo‚Äôs theory (adopted by Austrians), tariffs undermine the benefits of international trade by discouraging specialization. They stifle the gains from trade that arise when countries focus on producing goods where they hold efficiency advantages.\n\n4. **Government Overreach**: Tariffs represent coercive state intervention, violating the Austrian emphasis on voluntary exchange. Murray Rothbard and others viewed them as tools of crony capitalism, enabling bureaucrats to pick winners and losers rather than allowing market competition to prevail.\n\n5. **Retaliation and Trade Wars**: Austrians warn that tariffs often provoke retaliatory measures, escalating into trade conflicts that shrink global economic output. This aligns with their broader skepticism of centralized economic planning, whether domestic or international.",

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

That FAAFO is ultimately how people learn what they actually prefer.\n\nI also believe that this epoch we start building the citadels & free cities that have captured many of our imaginations.

C corp holds this bitcoin in its treasury. In exchange for bitcoin levered equity in c corp shares, an investor bankrolls land acquisitions. The c corp transfers the title to land to the llc within c corp.",

    "content": "## Our Moral Obsession\n\nHumans are moral obsessives. Anywhere you go, you‚Äôll find people speaking in moral terms: ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt treat me right,‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs arrogant,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a man you can respect,‚Äù and so on. All of these are moral judgments. Even confirmed criminals will routinely say things like, ‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt right,‚Äù which is, again, a purely moral judgment.\n\nOn top of that, moral judgments vary fairly little between individuals. There are exceptions, of course, but nearly all of us will agree on the majority of moral judgments, staying close to the model of the golden rule.\n\nAcademic ethics are incomprehensible and ‚Äúlifeboat‚Äù scenarios are distractions: They fail to illuminate much, while clouding what is useful. And so most of us listen to them for a moment, are confused for a moment more, then go back to ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt like it if I did that to him.‚Äù\n\nThis obsession of ours holds firm across almost the whole of human of life. Examine any workplace and you‚Äôll find a long stream of moral judgments. Examine any home and you‚Äôll find a long string of moral judgments.\n\nSo, What‚Äôs The Problem?\nGiven that nearly everyone is a moral obsessive, and given that we all refer, more or less, to the golden rule as a point of reference, how come there‚Äôs still so much immorality in the world?\n\nThe answer is that there really isn‚Äôt.\n\nFirst of all, people focus hard on the things that are wrong, but massively ignore the things that go right. When driving, for example, they flatly ignore hundreds of reasonable drivers and expend their venom on the one bad driver. The fact is that 90-some percent of everyday life is morally acceptable.\n\nSecondly, people often tie morality to dogma: They describe deviations from their political or religious doctrines as immoral, even when they‚Äôre not substantial violations of the golden rule. Political and religious dogmas shouldn‚Äôt be confused with morality.\n\nSo, while there are always moral failings, they aren‚Äôt nearly as many as advertised.\n\nThe real problem with human morality is simply that it‚Äôs focused every which way. Moral concerns, to put it simply, are scattered and wasted.\n\nThe internal energies of a mainstream couple, for example, are almost fully directed away from any effective use. They devote their moral strength to whatever terror (real or imagined) is in the news that day, to a sports team, to hating a political party, and so on. \n\nWe Can Easily Turn This Around\nWe‚Äôve been expending oceans of moral energy, to very little positive effect, but it doesn‚Äôt have to stay that way: We could, if we wanted, focus our energies to create improvements in the world.\n\nYeah, really, we could. And at some point people will. I think that should be us, and it requires just one thing of us:\n\nWe must focus on what we want, instead of what we fear.\n\nIt really is that simple, although ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù don‚Äôt always travel together. In particular, progress requires us to give up on gathering all the bad news in the world. The dark obsession leaves us with a large cloud of darkness filling our field of view, which negates most of our forward progress.\n\nSome generation is going to walk away from this mania of negativity, and it may as well be ours.\n\nLast Words\n\nThere can be endless quibbles and distractions from this point. Changing our focus would threaten everything from emotional crutches to nation-state power, and so the people benefiting from our fear and hate will fight against any change of focus. But I won‚Äôt waste our time on those things today. Rather, I‚Äôll say this:\n\nIf we focus on the things we want, instead of those we fear, it will be only a short time before we start getting them.\n\nBy changing our moral focus from dark to light ‚Äì focusing our imaginations on what we love, instead of what we hate ‚Äì we will renovate ourselves (beginning immediately) and the world shortly thereafter.\n\nAnd again: Some generation is going to see how reasonable this is, and how retrograde the old way was. It may as well be ours.\n\n**\n\nPaul Rosenberg\n\nfreemansperspective.com",

Mises ‚Äì Economic Calculation Problem: Without market-driven prices, socialist economies lack a mechanism for rational resource allocation, leading to inefficiency, waste, and economic collapse due to the impossibility of effective central planning.\n\n2. Hayek ‚Äì Knowledge Problem: Economic knowledge is decentralised and constantly changing; central planners cannot access or process this information effectively, making socialist planning inherently flawed and inferior to spontaneous order in free markets.\n\n3. Rothbard ‚Äì Ownership Problem: Socialism divorces ownership from responsibility, resulting in mismanagement, waste, and perverse incentives where resources are depleted rather than preserved, as no individual has direct accountability for their use.\n\n4. Hoppe ‚Äì Argumentation Ethics: Socialists deny self-ownership and property rights but rely on them when arguing, making socialism philosophically self-contradictory, as rational discourse presupposes individual control over one's body and actions.\n\n5. Bastiat ‚Äì Seen and Unseen: Socialists ignore unintended consequences, focusing only on immediate benefits while neglecting hidden economic costs, such as wealth destruction, inefficiency, and reduced innovation caused by government intervention.\n\n6. Saifedean ‚Äì Time Preference: Socialism raises societal time preference by discouraging savings and investment, leading to short-term consumption, economic stagnation, and deterioration of capital accumulation necessary for long-term prosperity and civilization-building. \n\n7. Menger ‚Äì Subjective Value Theory: Socialism fails because value is subjective, not intrinsic; only free markets can determine prices based on individual preferences, making socialist price-setting arbitrary, inefficient, and economically destructive.\n\n8. B√∂hm-Bawerk ‚Äì Capital and Interest: Socialism misunderstands capital structure and time preference, failing to account for how interest rates coordinate production over time, leading to resource misallocation and economic stagnation under central planning. have debunked Socialism.

I finally have enough done and feel comfortable to share my progress on HAMSTR. \n\nYou are about to witness perhaps the first ever(well outside of the 2,000 ones I have done testing, lol) nostr note retrieved exclusively over HF packet ham radio.\n\nThere is no Internet access on this browser at the moment at all.\n\nIt is a client - server setup. The client is fully off-grid. Only the server can connect to the internet.  For this test, the server is was roughly 500 feet away using dummy loads on my radios putting out virtually zero watts. Yes, not far, but in theory it would similar at  hundreds and even thousands of miles away as well.  \n\nThis test pulls my most recent notes from my fake dev account following list. In this case 1 note. The number of notes is configurable, but keep in mind HF Packet Radio is SLOW.  This one note takes quite a while for just  tiny note from nostr:nprofile1qqsywt6ypu57lxtwj2scdwxnyrl3sry9typcstje65x7rw9a2e5nq8sprpmhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuumwdae8gtnnda3kjctvqydhwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnzd96xxmmfdecxzunt9e3k7mgpp4mhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mq9hxafw.  Future versions will have FM Data packets as well, but line of sight FM was not my goal.  Global coverage was. HF radio is the only way for that.\n\nMost functionality is now working, just ironing out some things and lots of bugs. Following, global, search, hash tags, npub search display names, are all basically working. Soon replies.\n\nWhat started out as a project for me to use some social media and take camping and do some off-grid nostr stuff has now morphed into something that I believe will be able to help millions of people be able to bypass oppressive regimes, firewalls, tyranny, and allow them to interact with the nostr network using nothing but ham radios. This could be massive for learning, comms, and overall freedom. Could have a server running in France, and connect to it from Russia or Afghanistan for example. Easily within HF radio reach for half the world.\n\nMuch like the winlink email network, I hope people will be able to take my project and setup servers all around the world for people to access, read, write notes, send DM's, use various nostr kinds and even send Bitcoin(on chain offline transactions over HF radio and nostr coming soon).\n\n\nLots to come!\n\nNote: pardon the phone screen cap, it isn't quite working fully android Firefox or chrome yet.\n\nnostr:nprofile1qqsw3znfr6vdnxrujezjrhlkqqjlvpcqx79ys7gcph9mkjjsy7zsgygpr9mhxue69uhhqatjv9mxjerp9ehx7um5wghxcctwvsq3samnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwdehhxarjd93kztnrdaksz9thwden5te0wfjkccte9ekk7um5wgh8qatz7tvu4p\nnostr:nprofile1qqszw48usckkhs9hcwt3q3np9k2z2c73s8qc0gu3uxqw66cqlq88ukcpz4mhxue69uhk2er9dchxummnw3ezumrpdejqzynhwden5te0wfjkccte9enrw73wd9hszgmhwden5te0wfjkccte9eek7an9wfjkjemwv4hxw6twv4jhy6twvuhxjmczv5ddh\nnostr:nprofile1qqs9336p4f3sctdrtft2wlqaq5upjz9azpgylhfd3dplwf005mfrr9spzamhxue69uhkummnw3ezuendwsh8w6t69e3xj7spz3mhxue69uhkummnw3ezummcw3ezuer9wcq3qamnwvaz7tmwdaehgu3wwa5kueg6g89xw\n\n\n#hamstr\n#Nostr\n#development\n#hamradio\n\nhttps://video.nostr.build/1830960c328baad59ce74bfb23e7d3ea12bb26ea09f085e8a14762bb2cac88d4.mp4\n\n",

    "content": "Trident Vault Tour!\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/OGkT.mp4\n\nHere is a bit of what we have been working on behind the scenes at AnchorWatch   with Trident Vault. We are quickly doing feature enhancements based on user feedback - we're looking to hear from you!\n\nSome of Trident's special features that are shown in the video:\n\n1. View Only Vaults - You can add anyone (lawyer, board of directors, trustee, family member, accountant, heirs, etc) to a view-only dashboard of your vault.\n\n2. Instant Deposit/Spend Notifications - We are scanning the mempool continually to detect when a deposit is made into one of your vaults. Upon broadcast, you'll get an email and a notification in your dashboard of a deposit . Spends too!\n\n3. Vault Thresholds - When creating your vault, you select if you want to use the \"Hodl Discount\" - which is setting up your vault to not be spendable for the length of the policy. Alternatively, you can set thresholds based on your vaults total balance ranging from 10-100%, with no spending limits.\n\n4. Address Whitelists - To add a new address to your vault for withdrawal, a 3 or 7 day cooldown is required before you can initiate the spend.\n\n5. Visualized Vault Configuration - See exactly how your vault's smart contract is deployed with an easy visual diagram!\n\n6. Recovery Kit - in the event Trident is offline, or you wish to not use our software, you are able to load your Vault into Bitcoin Core to control your bitcoin with AnchorWatch. This functionality allows for cross verification of deposit addresses and verifying transaction history yourself. Importantly, this also lets you audit the configuration of how your vault is set up!\n\n7. Signature Requests - if you authorized an additional Key Holder on your Trident Vault, upon creating a transaction you can send them a notification & email about your request for a spend.\n\n8. Advanced Spending Features - We have full support for coin control ror UTXO management as well as multi output spends, to help with your accounting, payment privacy, and batch payments.\n\n9. Signing Device Dashboard - Review all signing devices associated with vaults you interact with. Helpful for verification & coordinating new vaults.\n\n10. Payments History - Review your previous payments to AnchorWatch.\n\n11. File a Claim - in the event there has been a loss incident with your Trident Vault, you can file a claim directly within the dashboard.\n\n12. Transaction Summary - You can review all of your transactions across each vault, and apply filtering for your own reporting needs",

    "content": "So we're regularly noticing how unacceptably large Foundry has gotten and it would be good if Bitcoiners in general understand why we are where we are.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what it is pools actually do, starting from the theoretical going all the way the practical.\n\nIn theory they make no difference to anything - they simply reduce variance.\n\nInstead of earning $.X per year, you earn $.X/365 per day.\n\nThis is far more consistent and makes day to day operations easier and it's clear why someone would want to do this - assuming they're a smaller miner who is not capable of finding block frequently enough without pooling and splitting rewards with others.\n\nThis might be desirable to the point where you'd even pay a split to the coordinator (pool) because it's that valuable of a service.\n\nTo take it further, the absolute hands-down most common payout model for a pool to use is FPPS - this doubles down on the supposed benefit that is so compelling here. It stands for Full Pay Pay Share which -in theory - means that miners get paid on a share to share basis (something they're submitting multiple times a minute) a highly predictable amount.\n\nThis means you not only have you abandoned dealing with lotto-variance (waiting until you find a block) or even standard pool variance (waiting until someone on the pool finds a block) but instead you're mining with a pool that grants you earnings multiple times per minute regardless of if the pool is finding any blocks or not.\n\nThis is variance reduction to such an extreme that the product becomes unbelievably expensive because pools have now put themselves in a position where they must pay miners for blocks that might - and very often don't - happen.\n\nThis was demonstrated beyond doubt when OCEAN (non-FPPS) released its numbers and they outperformed FPPS by over 30% in some cases during its first year of operation.\n\n*Note: This is NOT a \"You should mine on OCEAN\" post. I am simply trying to explain why miners are making the decisions they are because it seems to be eluding almost everyone.\n\nSo miners are apparently opting for variance reduction to the point where they want to get paid no matter what for blocks that may or may not even exist with resolution all the way down to the share level.\n\nBut here's the part where the disconnect between theory and reality comes in.\n\nNearly all the miners on Foundry have absolutely zero need for this kind of variance reduction - or indeed any at all.\n\nThe publicly traded miners that make use of Foundry all have the ability to find multiple blocks a day without any third party whatsoever which is way more than enough.\n\nAs mentioned already, FPPS is an extremely expensive product that logically would only be required by a miner faced with 24 hourly energy bills who only has 100 Petahash or so. Again, the typical Foundry miner is 100 times the size of this coming in at almost 10 Exahash at the smaller end.\n\nSo if Foundry solves a particular issue - variance - and charges a fortune to do it, and its main customer is miners that could lotto-mine and find multiple blocks a day without incurring the costs of FPPS then what on Earth are they doing?\n\nThe naive answer is that they haven't done the maths. In some cases I actually know this to be true. You're an enormous miner and you do a deal with Foundry - they charge you 0.1% fee and you think that's equivalent to if you cut out the middle man entirely pretty much so it becomes worth it.\n\nBut with FPPS the fee is never the fee. That is the airport currency exchange sign that says \"0% COMMISSION\" and gives you something about 14% worse than market rate. Where is the money going?\n\nI don't think most miners are actually making that mistake, at least not all of them.\n\nIt's time to explain the real reason here.\n\nCompliance by proxy.\n\nAnd this is what's key to understand.\n\nHistory: Once upon a time a pool called GHash(.)io got above 40% of the hashrate (which Foundry is doing repeatedly at this point) and the miners all fled out of instinct to protect the network. You simply cannot have any single entity making 50% of the blocks that get added to the chain or anything approaching that.\n\nSo why aren't miners doing it today? Are they that addicted to variance reduction when the calibre of miner that uses Foundry is perfectly capable of reducing their own variance anyway even though it's costing them a fortune?\n\nAgain the entire space needs to understand why history will not be repeating itself here and this where I find the greatest amount of self-delusion and dishonesty in this space.\n\nCompliance by proxy was not a thing in 2016. At least not for miners.\n\nSince then, someone has come along and turned what is completely unacceptable to the powers that be - Bitcoin mining - and turned it into a completely sanitized, censorship prone shell of its former self - and *that* is the true motivation for \"miners\" paying these exorbitant fees.\n\nCompliance is new. And it isn't a factor people are taking into consideration.\n\nWhenever we point out how precarious the situation has become, there is the typical response - \"If Foundry ever do <bad thing> then their miners will just leave\".\n\nIt's time to put this cope-strategy to bed.\n\nIf a miner is perfectly capable of reducing their own variance to the tune of reliably finding multiple blocks per day themselves - why are they using a pool at all? Especially if that pool costs a fortune?\n\nOr more crudely - If losing a tonne of money for no apparent reason isn't compelling enough to leave Foundry, then jeopardizing Bitcoin isn't going to be either.\n\nThe true motivation is all that matters, and its overwhelmingly just compliance. \"Miners\" of substantial size increasingly do not want anything to do with Bitcoin and want all their hashrate transformed from raw Bitcoins coming fresh out of the blockchain into a nice clean product that their accountants and lawyers can tolerate regardless of the cost.\n\nTo take the counter position to my argument here, there are of course costs to rough-housing it and grappling with Bitcoin directly as MARA does and I don't want to pretend otherwise but I don't think they come anything like close to justifying the enormity of the revenue lost due to the extreme over-kill that is FPPS.\n\nThis is the only area in which I will take pushback from someone in one of the relevant companies as it's possible I am just wrong.\n\nThe following companies - BitFarms, Hut8, RIOT, WULF, HIVE, Cleanspark and a couple of handfuls of others are all - to the best of my knowledge - paying a fortune for the combined benefit of variance reduction (which they absolutely have no need of) and compliance by proxy.\n\nIf anyone from any of those companies can explain to me why I am wrong and that if/when Foundry's size results in them engaging in censorship or any other abuse of the network (heck, already requiring KYC and regular inspections of mining facilities is unacceptable and that's already been the case for Foundry miners for years) then why should anyone believe you would move to another pool or go the Mara route?\n\nAt present I believe that Foundry could continue its inexorable ascent to the 51% magic number we're all afraid of and the new cope will be \"Well they haven't done <bad thing> yet\" and we'll just keep moving the goal posts about what constitutes a bad thing.\n\nAt the moment \"It's just KYC\", \"It's just mandatory inspections\" and \"It's just lost revenue.\"\n\nAll of that is unacceptable. \"It's just transactions associated with Russia/Iran\" comes next and the shareholders of publicly traded Bitcoin miners are unlikely to view censorship based on that criteria as being anything to worry about. \"Why do you hate America??\"\n\nThe old cope of \"another miner will just include them and their business will survive while the censoring miners die\" is complete and utter delusion.\n\nAlmost 100% of revenue from the chain is subsidy. Transaction fees are neither here nor there. And if we think the US Pubcos are all going to voluntarily go admit bankruptcy because they lost a few hundred bucks a week from mining blocks that censored blacklisted UTXOs then we are deluding ourselves.\n\nI reiterate - miners are with Foundry because compliance is increasingly all that matters. This has resulted in enormous centralization of template construction that becomes a genuine attack vector at ~30% and has been consistently way above that for a long time now. 51% is a meme, and imo not a powerful enough one to inspire change if it actually comes to that. The frogs are already boiling and no one cares.\n\nLet's be honest. None of the miners on Foundry are leaving any time soon but the variance reducing product they offer that can be so trivially replicated elsewhere is not why any of them are doing what they are doing.\n\nFoundry is the sole occupant within the regulatory moat that is Bitcoin mining in America and I don't see that as trivial to replicate at all. \n\nAnd the reason I wish to sound the alarm 10,000 louder than I have been before this point is that the current US administration has run a campaign that specifically talks about centralizing Bitcoin in the US.\n\nThe phrase \"We will make all the Bitcoins in America\" is exactly the worst possible thing you could want to hear given everything I've talked about in this post and not only is it not being rejected by Bitcoiners, it is being celebrated as a good thing.",

Like the real world, money is continuously injected into the system, causing inflation. The only way to win is by accumulating assets, but over time, the rich get richer while the poor struggle to survive, unable to escape high rent costs.\n\nA key moment in Monopoly is when the bank runs out of money. Some players declare game over, while others write IOUs and continue. The game‚Äôs official rule allows printing money on paper notes, just as central banks do in reality, devaluing existing money and worsening inflation.\n\nThought experiment: Imagine 100 Monopoly games running simultaneously, each representing a different country. Some maintain the $200 rule at GO, while others increase it to $300, $400, or more. Those who print more money quickly buy up all assets, leaving conservative players bankrupt. As inflation escalates, land prices skyrocket until money becomes worthless, leading to hyperinflation and economic collapse.\n\nThis mirrors real-world monetary policies, where nations compete to devalue their currencies, harming savers. Bitcoin offers a solution‚Äîa fixed supply, immune to inflation, outside government control. Unlike Monopoly, Bitcoin allows us to opt-out of the broken system and choose financial sovereignty.",

    "content": "## No Treason. No. VI. \n## The Constitution of No Authority \n### Lysander Spooner, 1870\n\nI.\nThe Constitution has no inherent authority or obligation. It has no authority or obligation at all, unless as a contract between man and man. And it does not so much as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing. It purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago. And it can be supposed to have been a contract then only between persons who had already come to years of discretion, so as to be competent to make reasonable and obligatory contracts. Furthermore, we know, historically, that only a small portion even of the people then existing were consulted on the subject, or asked, or permitted to express either their consent or dissent in any formal manner. Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And the Constitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they could bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, the instrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but ‚Äúthe people‚Äù then existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right, power, or disposition, on their part, to bind any body but themselves. Let us see. Its language is:\n\n‚ÄúWe, the people of the United States [that is, the people then existing in the United States], in order to form a more perfect union, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.‚Äù\n\nIt is plain, in the first place, that this language, as an agreement, purports to be only what it at most really was, viz: a contract between the people then existing; and, of necessity, binding, as a contract, only upon those then existing. In the second place, the language neither expresses nor implies that they had any intention or desire, nor that they imagined they had any right or power, to bind their ‚Äúposterity‚Äù to live under it. It does not say that their ‚Äúposterity‚Äù will, shall, or must live under it. It only says, in effect, that their hopes and motives in adopting it were that it might prove useful to their posterity, as well as to themselves, by promoting their union, safety, tranquillity, liberty, etc.\n\nSuppose an agreement were entered into, in this form:\n\nWe, the people of Boston, agree to maintain a fort on Governor‚Äôs Island, to protect ourselves and our posterity against invasion.\n\nThis agreement, as an agreement, would clearly bind nobody but the people then existing. Secondly, it would assert no right, power, or disposition, on their part, to compel their ‚Äúposterity‚Äù to maintain such a fort. It would only indicate that the supposed welfare of their posterity was one of the motives that induced the original parties to enter into the agreement.\n\nWhen a man says he is building a house for himself and his posterity, he does not mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of binding them, nor is it to be inferred that he is so foolish as to imagine that he has any right or power to bind them, to live in it. So far as they are concerned, he only means to be understood as saying that his hopes and motives, in building it, are that they, or at least some of them, may find it for their happiness to live in it.\n\nSo when a man says he is planting a tree for himself and his posterity, he does not mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of compelling them, nor is it to be inferred that he is such a simpleton as to imagine that he has any right or power to compel them, to eat the fruit. So far as they are concerned, he only means to say that his hopes and motives, in planting the tree, are that its fruit may be agreeable to them.\n\nSo it was with those who originally adopted the Constitution. Whatever may have been their personal intentions, the legal meaning of their language, so far as their ‚Äúposterity‚Äù was concerned, simply was, that their hopes and motives, in entering into the agreement, were that it might prove useful and acceptable to their posterity; that it might promote their union, safety, tranquillity, and welfare; and that it might tend ‚Äúto secure to them the blessings of liberty.‚Äù The language does not assert nor at all imply, any right, power, or disposition, on the part of the original parties to the agreement, to compel their ‚Äúposterity‚Äù to live under it. If they had intended to bind their posterity to live under it, they should have said that their object was, not ‚Äúto secure to them the blessings of liberty,‚Äù but to make slaves of them; for if their ‚Äúposterity‚Äù are bound to live under it, they are nothing less than the slaves of their foolish, tyrannical, and dead grandfathers.\n\nIt cannot be said that the Constitution formed ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù for all time, into a corporation. It does not speak of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù as a corporation, but as individuals. A corporation does not describe itself as ‚Äúwe,‚Äù nor as ‚Äúpeople,‚Äù nor as ‚Äúourselves.‚Äù Nor does a corporation, in legal language, have any ‚Äúposterity.‚Äù It supposes itself to have, and speaks of itself as having, perpetual existence, as a single individuality.\n\nMoreover, no body of men, existing at any one time, have the power to create a perpetual corporation. A corporation can become practically perpetual only by the voluntary accession of new members, as the old ones die off. But for this voluntary accession of new members, the corporation necessarily dies with the death of those who originally composed it.\n\nLegally speaking, therefore, there is, in the Constitution, nothing that professes or attempts to bind the ‚Äúposterity‚Äù of those who establish it.\n\nIf, then, those who established the Constitution, had no power to bind, and did not attempt to bind, their posterity, the question arises, whether their posterity have bound themselves? If they have done so, they can have done so in only one or both of these two ways, viz. by voting, and paying taxes.\n\nII.\nLet us consider these two matters, voting and tax paying, separately. And first of voting.\n\nAll the voting that has ever taken place under the Constitution, has been of such a kind that it not only did not pledge the whole people to support the Constitution, but it did not even pledge any one of them to do so, as the following considerations show.\n\n1. In the very nature of things, the act of voting could bind nobody but the actual voters. But owing to the property qualifications required, it is probable that, during the first twenty or thirty years under the Constitution, not more than one tenth, fifteenth, or perhaps twentieth of the whole population (black and white, men, women, and minors) were permitted to vote. Consequently, so far as voting was concerned, not more than one tenth, fifteenth, or twentieth of those then existing, could have incurred any obligation to support the Constitution.\n\nAt the present time, it is probable that not more than one sixth of the whole population are permitted to vote. Consequently, so far as voting is concerned, the other five-sixths can have given no pledge that they will support the Constitution.\n\n2. Of the one-sixth that are permitted to vote, probably not more than two-thirds (about one-ninth of the whole population) have usually voted. Many never vote at all. Many vote only once in two, three, five, or ten years, in periods of great excitement.\n\nNo one, by voting, can be said to pledge himself for any longer period than that for which he votes. If, for example, I vote for an officer who is to hold his office for only a year, I cannot be said to have thereby pledged myself to support the government beyond that term. Therefore, on the ground of actual voting, it probably cannot be said that more than one-ninth, or one-eighth, of the whole population are usually under any pledge to support the Constitution.\n\n3. It cannot be said that, by voting, a man pledges himself to support the Constitution, unless the act of voting be a perfectly voluntary one on his part. Yet the act of voting cannot properly be called a voluntary one on the part of any very large number of those who do vote. It is rather a measure of necessity imposed upon them by others, than one of their own choice. On this point I repeat what was said in a former number,\n\n‚ÄúIn truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having even been asked a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practise this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further, that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man attempts to take the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot‚Äîwhich is a mere substitute for a bullet‚Äîbecause, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency into which he had been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered, he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.\n\n‚ÄúDoubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby meliorating their condition. But it would not, therefore, be a legitimate inference that the government itself, that crushes them, was one which they had voluntarily set up, or ever consented to.\n\n‚ÄúTherefore, a man‚Äôs voting under the Constitution of the United States, is not to be taken as evidence that he ever freely assented to the Constitution, even for the time being. Consequently we have no proof that any very large portion, even of the actual voters of the United States, ever really and voluntarily consented to the Constitution, even for the time being. Nor can we ever have such proof, until every man is left perfectly free to consent, or not, without thereby subjecting himself or his property to be disturbed or injured by others.‚Äù\n\nAs we can have no legal knowledge as to who votes from choice, and who from the necessity thus forced upon him, we can have no legal knowledge, as to any particular individual, that he voted from choice; or, consequently, that by voting, he consented, or pledged himself, to support the government. Legally speaking, therefore, the act of voting utterly fails to pledge any one to support the government. It utterly fails to prove that the government rests upon the voluntary support of any body. On general principles of law and reason, it cannot be said that the government has any voluntary supporters at all, until it can be distinctly shown who its voluntary supporters are.\n\n4. As taxation is made compulsory on all, whether they vote or not, a large proportion of those who vote, no doubt do so to prevent their own money being used against themselves; when, in fact, they would have gladly abstained from voting, if they could thereby have saved themselves from taxation alone, to say nothing of being saved from all the other usurpations and tyrannies of the government. To take a man‚Äôs property without his consent, and then to infer his consent because he attempts, by voting, to prevent that property from being used to his injury, is a very insufficient proof of his consent to support the Constitution. It is, in fact, no proof at all. And as we can have no legal knowledge as to who the particular individuals are, if there are any, who are willing to be taxed for the sake of voting, or who would prefer freedom from taxation to the privilege of voting, we can have no legal knowledge that any particular individual consents to be taxed for the sake of voting; or, consequently, consents to support the Constitution.\n\n5. At nearly all elections, votes are given for various candidates for the same office. Those who vote for the unsuccessful candidates cannot properly be said to have voted to sustain the Constitution. They may, with more reason, be supposed to have voted, not to support the Constitution, but specially to prevent the tyranny which they anticipate the successful candidate intends to practise upon them under color of the Constitution; and therefore may reasonably be supposed to have voted against the Constitution itself. This supposition is the more reasonable, inasmuch as such voting is the only mode allowed to them of expressing their dissent to the Constitution.\n\n6. Many votes are usually given for candidates who have no prospect of success. Those who give such votes may reasonably be supposed to have voted as they did, with a special intention, not to support, but to obstruct the execution of, the Constitution; and, therefore, against the Constitution itself.\n\n7. As all the different votes are given secretly (by secret ballot), there is no legal means of knowing, from the votes themselves, who votes for, and who against, the Constitution. Therefore voting affords no legal evidence that any particular individual supports the Constitution. And where there can be no legal evidence that any particular individual supports the Constitution, it cannot legally be said that anybody supports it. It is clearly impossible to have any legal proof of the intentions of large numbers of men, where there can be no legal proof of the intentions of any particular one of them.\n\n8. There being no legal proof of any man‚Äôs intentions, in voting, we can only conjecture them. As a conjecture, it is probable that a very large proportion of those who vote, do so on this principle, viz., that if, by voting, they could but get the government into their own hands (or that of their friends), and use its powers against their opponents, they would then willingly support the Constitution; but if their opponents are to have the power, and use it against them, then they would not willingly support the Constitution.\n\nIn short, men‚Äôs voluntary support of the Constitution is doubtless, in most cases, wholly contingent upon the question whether, by means of the Constitution, they can make themselves masters, or are to be made slaves.\n\nSuch contingent consent as that is, in law and reason, no consent at all.\n\n9. As every body who supports the Constitution by voting (if there are any such) does so secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to avoid all personal responsibility for the acts of his agents or representatives, it cannot legally or reasonably be said that anybody at all supports the Constitution by voting. No man can reasonably or legally be said to do such a thing as to assent to, or support, the Constitution, unless he does it openly, and in a way to make himself personally responsible for the acts of his agents, so long as they act within the limits of the power he delegates to them.\n\n10. As all voting is secret, (by secret ballot,) and as all secret governments are necessarily only secret bands of robbers, tyrants, and murderers, the general fact that our government is practically carried on by means of such voting, only proves that there is among us a secret band of robbers, tyrants and murderers, whose purpose is to rob, enslave, and, so far as necessary to accomplish their purposes, murder, the rest of the people. The simple fact of the existence of such a band does nothing towards proving that ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù or any one of them, voluntarily supports the Constitution.\n\nFor all the reasons that have now been given, voting furnishes no legal evidence as to who the particular individuals are (if there are any), who voluntarily support the Constitution. It therefore furnishes no legal evidence that any body supports it voluntarily.\n\nSo far, therefore, as voting is concerned, the Constitution, legally speaking, has no supporters at all.\n\nAnd, as matter of fact, there is not the slightest probability that the Constitution has a single bona fide supporter in the country. That is to say, there is not the slightest probability that there is a single man in the country, who both understands what the Constitution really is, and sincerely supports it for what it really is.\n\nThe ostensible supporters of the Constitution, like the ostensible supporters of most other governments, are made up of three classes, viz.: 1. Knaves, a numerous and active class, who see in the government an instrument which they can use for their own aggrandizement or wealth. 2. Dupes‚Äîa large class, no doubt‚Äîeach of whom, because he is allowed one voice out of millions in deciding what he may do with his own person and his own property, and because he is permitted to have the same voice in robbing, enslaving, and murdering others, that others have in robbing, enslaving, and murdering himself, is stupid enough to imagine that he is a ‚Äúfree man,‚Äù a ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù; that this is ‚Äúa free government‚Äù; ‚Äúa government of equal rights,‚Äù ‚Äúthe best government on earth,‚Äù\n\n3. A class who have some appreciation of the evils of government, but either do not see how to get rid of them, or do not choose to so far sacrifice their private interests as to give themselves seriously and earnestly to the work of making a change.\n\nIII.\nThe payment of taxes, being compulsory, of course furnishes no evidence that any one voluntarily supports the Constitution.\n\nIt is true that the theory of our Constitution is, that all taxes are paid voluntarily; that our government is a mutual insurance company, voluntarily entered into by the people with each other; that each man makes a free and purely voluntary contract with all others who are parties to the Constitution, to pay so much money for so much protection, the same as he does with any other insurance company; and that he is just as free not to be protected, and not to pay any tax, as he is to pay a tax, and be protected.\n\nBut this theory of our government is wholly different from the practical fact. The fact is that the government, like a highwayman, says to a man: Your money, or your life. And many, if not most, taxes are paid under the compulsion of that threat.\n\nThe government does not, indeed, waylay a man in a lonely place, spring upon him from the road side, and, holding a pistol to his head, proceed to rifle his pockets. But the robbery is none the less a robbery on that account; and it is far more dastardly and shameful.\n\nThe highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit. He does not pretend to be anything but a robber. He has not acquired impudence enough to profess to be merely a ‚Äúprotector,‚Äù and that he takes men‚Äôs money against their will, merely to enable him to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù those infatuated travellers, who feel perfectly able to protect themselves, or do not appreciate his peculiar system of protection. He is too sensible a man to make such professions as these. Furthermore, having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do. He does not persist in following you on the road, against your will; assuming to be your rightful ‚Äúsovereign,‚Äù on account of the ‚Äúprotection‚Äù he affords you. He does not keep ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù you, by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do that; by robbing you of more money as often as he finds it for his interest or pleasure to do so; and by branding you as a rebel, a traitor, and an enemy to your country, and shooting you down without mercy, if you dispute his authority, or resist his demands. He is too much of a gentleman to be guilty of such impostures, and insults, and villanies as these. In short, he does not, in addition to robbing you, attempt to make you either his dupe or his slave.\n\nThe proceedings of those robbers and murderers, who call themselves ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù are directly the opposite of these of the single highwayman.\n\nIn the first place, they do not, like him, make themselves individually known; or, consequently, take upon themselves personally the responsibility of their acts. On the contrary, they secretly (by secret ballot) designate some one of their number to commit the robbery in their behalf, while they keep themselves practically concealed. They say to the person thus designated:\n\nGo to A‚Äî B‚Äî, and say to him that ‚Äúthe government‚Äù has need of money to meet the expenses of protecting him and his property. If he presumes to say that he has never contracted with us to protect him, and that he wants none of our protection, say to him that that is our business, and not his; that we choose to protect him, whether he desires us to do so or not; and that we demand pay, too, for protecting him. If he dares to inquire who the individuals are, who have thus taken upon themselves the title of ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù and who assume to protect him, and demand payment of him, without his having ever made any contract with them, say to him that that, too, is our business, and not his; that we do not choose to make ourselves individually known to him; that we have secretly (by secret ballot) appointed you our agent to give him notice of our demands, and, if he complies with them, to give him, in our name, a receipt that will protect him against any similar demand for the present year. If he refuses to comply, seize and sell enough of his property to pay not only our demands, but all your own expenses and trouble beside. If he resists the seizure of his property, call upon the bystanders to help you (doubtless some of them will prove to be members of our band). If, in defending his property, he should kill any of our band who are assisting you, capture him at all hazards; charge him (in one of our courts) with murder, convict him, and hang him. If he should call upon his neighbors, or any others who, like him, may be disposed to resist our demands, and they should come in large numbers to his assistance, cry out that they are all rebels and traitors; that ‚Äúour country‚Äù is in danger; call upon the commander of our hired murderers; tell him to quell the rebellion and ‚Äúsave the country,‚Äù cost what it may. Tell him to kill all who resist, though they should be hundreds of thousands; and thus strike terror into all others similarly disposed. See that the work of murder is thoroughly done, that we may have no further trouble of this kind hereafter. When these traitors shall have thus been taught our strength and our determination, they will be good loyal citizens for many years, and pay their taxes without a why or a wherefore.\n\nIt is under such compulsion as this that taxes, so called, are paid. And how much proof the payment of taxes affords, that the people consent to support ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù it needs no further argument to show.\n\n2. Still another reason why the payment of taxes implies no consent, or pledge, to support the government, is that the tax payer does not know, and has no means of knowing, who the particular individuals are who compose ‚Äúthe government.‚Äù To him ‚Äúthe government‚Äù is a myth, an abstraction, an incorporeality, with which he can make no contract, and to which he can give no consent, and make no pledge. He knows it only through its pretended agents. ‚ÄúThe government‚Äù itself he never sees. He knows indeed, by common report, that certain persons, of a certain age, are permitted to vote; and thus to make themselves parts of, or (if they choose) opponents of, the government, for the time being. But who of them do thus vote, and especially how each one votes (whether so as to aid or oppose the government), he does not know; the voting being all done secretly (by secret ballot). Who, therefore, practically compose ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù for the time being, he has no means of knowing. Of course he can make no contract with them, give them no consent, and make them no pledge. Of necessity, therefore, his paying taxes to them implies, on his part, no contract, consent, or pledge to support them‚Äîthat is, to support ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù or the Constitution.\n\n3. Not knowing who the particular individuals are, who call themselves ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù the tax payer does not know whom he pays his taxes to. All he knows is that a man comes to him, representing himself to be the agent of ‚Äúthe government‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the agent of a secret band of robbers and murderers, who have taken to themselves the title of ‚Äúthe government,‚Äù and have determined to kill every body who refuses to give them whatever money they demand. To save his life, he gives up his money to this agent. But as this agent does not make his principals individually known to the tax payer, the latter, after he has given up his money, knows no more who are ‚Äúthe government‚Äù‚Äîthat is, who were the robbers‚Äîthan he did before. To say, therefore, that by giving up his money to their agent, he entered into a voluntary contract with them, that he pledges himself to obey them, to support them, and to give them whatever money they should demand of him in the future, is simply ridiculous.\n\n4. All political power, as it is called, rests practically upon this matter of money. Any number of scoundrels, having money enough to start with, can establish themselves as a ‚Äúgovernment;‚Äù because, with money, they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort more money; and also compel general obedience to their will. It is with government, as C√¶sar said it was in war, that money and soldiers mutually supported each other; that with money he could hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort money. So these villains, who call themselves governments, well understand that their power rests primarily upon money. With money they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort money. And, when their authority is denied, the first use they always make of money, is to hire soldiers to kill or subdue all who refuse them more money.\n\nFor this reason, whoever desires liberty, should understand these vital facts. That every man who puts money into the hands of a ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù (so called), puts into its hands a sword which will be used against himself, to extort more money from him, and also to keep him in subjection to its arbitrary will. 2. That those who will take his money, without his consent, in the first place, will use it for his further robbery and enslavement, if he presumes to resist their demands in the future. 3. That it is a perfect absurdity to suppose that any body of men would ever take a man‚Äôs money without his consent, for any such object as they profess to take it for, viz., that of protecting him; for why should they wish to protect him, if he does not wish them to do so? To suppose that they would do so, is just as absurd as it would be to suppose that they would take his money without his consent, for the purpose of buying food or clothing for him, when he did not want it. 4. If a man wants ‚Äúprotection,‚Äù he is competent to make his own bargains for it; and nobody has any occasion to rob him, in order to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù him against his will. 5. That the only security men can have for their political liberty, consists in their keeping their money in their own pockets, until they have assurances, perfectly satisfactory to themselves, that it will be used as they wish it to be used, for their benefit, and not for their injury. 6. That no government, so called, can reasonably be trusted for a moment, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view, any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support.\n\nThese facts are all so vital and so self-evident, that it cannot reasonably be supposed that any one will voluntarily pay money to a ‚Äúgovernment,‚Äù for the purpose of securing its protection, unless he first makes an explicit and purely voluntary contract with it for that purpose.\n\nIt is perfectly evident, therefore, that neither such voting, nor such payment of taxes, as actually takes place, proves anybody‚Äôs consent, or obligation, to support the Constitution. Consequently we have no evidence at all that the Constitution is binding upon anybody, or that anybody is under any contract or obligation whatever to support it. And nobody is under any obligation to support it.\n\nIV\nThe Constitution not only binas nobody now, but it never did bind anybody. It never bound anybody, because it was never agreed to by any body in such a manner as to make it, on general principles of law and reason, binding upon him.\n\nIt is a general principle of law and reason, that a written instrument binds no one until he has signed it. This principle is so inflexible a one, that even though a man is unable to write his name, he must still ‚Äúmake his mark,‚Äù before he is bound by a written contract. This custom was established ages ago, when few men could write their names; when a clerk‚Äîthat is, a man who could write‚Äîwas so rare and valuable a person, that even if he were guilty of high crimes, he was entitled to pardon, on the ground that the public could not afford to lose his services. Even at that time, a written contract must be signed; and men who could not write, either ‚Äúmade their mark,‚Äù or signed their contracts by stamping their seals upon wax affixed to the parchment on which their contracts were written. Hence the custom of affixing seals, that has continued to this time.\n\nThe law holds, and reason declares, that if a written instrument is not signed, the presumption must be that the party to be bound by it, did not choose to sign it, or to bind himself by it. And law and reason both give him until the last moment, in which to decide whether he will sign it, or not. Neither law nor reason requires or expects a man to agree to an instrument, until it is written; for until it is written, he cannot know its precise legal meaning. And when it is written, and he has had the opportunity to satisfy himself of its precise legal meaning, he is then expected to decide, and not before, whether he will agree to it or not. And if he do not then sign it, his reason is supposed to be, that he does not choose to enter into such a contract. The fact that the instrument was written for him to sign, or with the hope that he would sign it, goes for nothing.\n\nWhere would be the end of fraud and litigation, if one party could bring into court a written instrument, without any signature, and claim to have it enforced, upon the ground that it was written for another man to sign? that this other man had promised to sign it? that he ought to have signed it? that he had had the opportunity to sign it, if he would? but that he had refused or neglected to do so? yet that is the most that could ever be said of the Constitution.\n\n The very judges, who profess to derive all their authority from the Constitution‚Äîfrom an instrument that nobody ever signed‚Äîwould spurn any other instrument, not signed, that should be brought before them for adjudication.\n\nMoreover, a written instrument must, in law and reason, not only be signed, but must also be delivered to the party (or to some one for him), in whose favor it is made, before it can bind the party making it. The signing is of no effect, unless the instrument be also delivered. And a party is at perfect liberty to refuse to deliver a written instrument, after he has signed it. He is as free to refuse to deliver it, as he is to refuse to sign it. The constitution was not only never signed by anybody, but it was never delivered by anybody to anybody, or to anybody‚Äôs agent or attorney. It can therefore be of no more validity as a contract, than can any other instrument, that was never signed or delivered.\n\nV\nAs further evidence of the general sense of mankind, as to the practical necessity there is that all men‚Äôs important contracts, especially those of a permanent nature, should be both written and signed, the following facts are pertinent.\n\nFor nearly two hundred years‚Äîthat is, since 1677‚Äîthere has been on the statute book of England, and the same, in substance, if not precisely in letter, has been re-enacted, and is now in force, in nearly or quite all the States of this Union, a statute, the general object of which is to declare that no action shall be brought to enforce contracts of the more important class, unless they are put in writing, and signed by the parties to be held chargeable upon them.\n\nThe principle of the statute, be it observed, is, not merely that written contracts shall be signed, but also that all contracts, except those specially exempted‚Äîgenerally those that are for small amounts, and are to remain in force but for a short time‚Äîshall be both written and signed.\n\nThe reason of the statute, on this point, is, that it is now so easy a thing for men to put their contracts in writing, and sign them, and their failure to do so opens the door to so much doubt, fraud, and litigation, that men who neglect to have their contracts‚Äîof any considerable importance‚Äîwritten and signed, ought not to have the benefit of courts of justice to enforce them. And this reason is a wise one; and that experience has confirmed its wisdom and necessity, is demonstrated by the fact that it has been acted upon in England for nearly two hundred years, and has been so nearly universally adopted in this country, and that nobody thinks of repealing it.\n\nWe all know, too, how careful most men are to have their contracts written and signed, even when this statute does not require it. For example, most men, if they have money due them, of no larger amount than five or ten dollars, are careful to take a note for it. If they buy even a small bill of goods, paying for it at the time of delivery, they take a receipted bill for it. If they pay a small balance of a book account, or any other small debt previously contracted, they take a written receipt for it.\n\nFurthermore, the law everywhere (probably) in our country, as well as in England, requires that a large class of contracts, such as wills, deeds, etc., shall not only be written and signed, but also sealed, witnessed, and acknowledged. And in the case of married women conveying their rights in real estate, the law, in many States, requires that the women shall be examined separate and apart from their husbands, and declare that they sign their contracts free of any fear or compulsion of their husbands.\n\nSuch are some of the precautions which the laws require, and which individuals‚Äîfrom motives of common prudence, even in cases not required by law‚Äîtake, to put their contracts in writing, and have them signed, &c., to guard against all uncertainties and controversies in regard to their meaning and validity. And yet we have what purports, or professes, or is claimed, to be a contract‚Äîthe Constitution‚Äîmade eighty years ago, by men who are now all dead, and who never had any power to bind us, but which (it is claimed) has nevertheless bound three generations of men, consisting of many millions, and which (it is claimed) will be binding upon all the millions that are to come; but which nobody ever signed, sealed, delivered, witnessed, or acknowledged; and which few persons, compared with the whole number that are claimed to be bound by it, have ever read, or even seen, or ever will read, or see. And of those who ever have read it, or ever will read it, scarcely any two, perhaps no two, have ever agreed, or ever will agree, as to what it means.\n\nMoreover, this supposed contract, which would not be received in any court of justice sitting under its authority, if offered to prove a debt of five dollars, owing by one man to another, is one by which‚Äîas it is generally interpreted by those who pretend to administer it‚Äîall men, women and children throughout the country, and through all time, surrender not only all their property, but also their liberties, and even lives, into the hands of men who by this supposed contract, are expressly made wholly irresponsible for their disposal of them. And we are so insane, or so wicked, as to destroy property and lives without limit, in fighting to compel men to fulfil a supposed contract, which, inasmuch as it has never been signed by anybody, is, on general principles of law and reason‚Äîsuch principles as we are all governed by in regard to other contracts‚Äîthe merest waste paper, binding upon nobody, fit only to be thrown into the fire; or, if preserved, preserved only to serve as a witness and a warning of the folly and wickedness of mankind.\n\nVI.\nIt is no exaggeration, but a literal truth, to say that, by the Constitution‚Äînot as I interpret it, but as it is interpreted by those who pretend to administer it‚Äîthe properties, liberties, and lives of the entire people of the United States are surrendered unreservedly into the hands of men who, it is provided by the Constitution itself, shall never be ‚Äúquestioned‚Äù as to any disposal they make of them.\n\nThus the Constitution (Art. 1, Sec. 6) provides that, ‚Äúfor any speech or debate [or vote,] in either house, they [the senators and representatives] shall not be questioned in any other place.‚Äù\n\nThe whole law-making power is given to these senators and representatives, [when acting by a two-thirds vote]; and this provision protects them from all responsibility for the laws they make.\n\nThe Constitution also enables them to secure the execution of all their laws, by giving them power to withhold the salaries of, and to impeach and remove, all judicial and executive officers, who refuse to execute them.\n\nThus the whole power of the government is in their hands, and they are made utterly irresponsible for the use they make of it. What is this but absolute, irresponsible power?\n\nIt is no answer to this view of the case to say that these men are under oath to use their power only within certain limits; for what care they, or what should they care, for oaths or limits, when it is expressly provided, by the Constitution itself, that they shall never be ‚Äúquestioned,‚Äù or held to any responsibility whatever, for violating their oaths, or transgressing those limits?\n\nNeither is it any answer to this view of the case to say that the particular individuals holding this power can be changed once in two or six years; for the power of each set of men is absolute during the term for which they hold it; and when they can hold it no longer, they are succeeded only by men whose power will be equally absolute and irresponsible.\n\nNeither is it any answer to this view of the case to say that the men holding this absolute, irresponsible power, must be men chosen by the people (or portions of them) to hold it. A man is none the less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years. Neither are a people any the less slaves because permitted periodically to choose new masters. What makes them slaves is the fact that they now are, and are always hereafter to be, in the hands of men whose power over them is, and always is to be, absolute and irresponsible.\n\nThe right of absolute and irresponsible dominion is the right of property, and the right of property is the right of absolute, irresponsible dominion. The two are identical; the one necessarily implying the other. Neither can exist without the other. If, therefore, Congress have that absolute and irresponsible law-making power, which the Constitution‚Äîaccording to their interpretation of it‚Äîgives them, it can only be because they own us as property. If they own us as property, they are our masters, and their will is our law. If they do not own us as property, they are not our masters, and their will, as such, is of no authority over us.\n\nBut these men who claim and exercise this absolute and irresponsible dominion over us, dare not be consistent, and claim either to be our masters, or to own us as property. They say they are only our servants, agents, attorneys, and representatives. But this declaration involves an absurdity, a contradiction. No man can be my servant, agent, attorney, or representative, and be, at the same time, uncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me for his acts. It is of no importance that I appointed him, and put all power in his hands. If I made him uncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me, he is no longer my servant, agent, attorney, or representative. If I gave him absolute, irresponsible power over my property, I gave him the property. If I gave him absolute, irresponsible power over myself, I made him my master, and gave myself to him as a slave. And it is of no importance whether I called him master or servant, agent or owner. The only question is, what power did I put into his hands? Was it an absolute and irresponsible one? or a limited and responsible one?\n\nFor still another reason they are neither our servants, agents, attorneys, nor representatives. And that reason is, that we do not make ourselves responsible for their acts. If a man is my servant, agent, or attorney, I necessarily make myself responsible for all his acts done within the limits of the power I have intrusted to him. If I have intrusted him, as my agent, with either absolute power, or any power at all, over the persons or properties of other men than myself, I thereby necessarily make myself responsible to those other persons for any injuries he may do them, so long as he acts within the limits of the power I have granted him. But no individual who may be injured in his person or property, by acts of Congress, can come to the individual electors, and hold them responsible for these acts of their so-called agents or representatives. This fact proves that these pretended agents of the people, of everybody, are really the agents of nobody.\n\nIf, then, nobody is individually responsible for the acts of Congress, the members of Congress are nobody‚Äôs agents. And if they are nobody‚Äôs agents, they are themselves individually responsible for their own acts, and for the acts of all whom they employ. And the authority they are exercising is simply their own individual authority; and, by the law of nature‚Äîthe highest of all laws‚Äîanybody injured by their acts, anybody who is deprived by them of his property or his liberty, has the same right to hold them individually responsible, that he has to hold any other trespasser individually responsible. He has the same right to resist them, and their agents, that he has to resist any other trespassers.\n\nVII.\nIt is plain, then, that on general principles of law and reason‚Äîsuch principles as we all act upon in courts of justice and in common life‚Äîthe Constitution is no contract; that it binds nobody, and never did bind anybody; and that all those who pretend to act by its authority, are really acting without any legitimate authority at all; that, on general principles of law and reason, they are mere usurpers, and that everybody not only has the right, but is morally bound, to treat them as such.\n\nIf the people of this country wish to maintain such a government as the Constitution describes, there is no reason in the world why they should not sign the instrument itself, and thus make known their wishes in an open, authentic manner; in such manner as the common sense and experience of mankind have shown to be reasonable and necessary in such cases; and in such manner as to make themselves (as they ought to do) individually responsible for the acts of the government. But the people have never been asked to sign it. And the only reason why they have never been asked to sign it, has been that it has been known that they never would sign it; that they were neither such fools nor knaves as they must needs have been to be willing to sign it; that (at least as it has been practically interpreted) it is not what any sensible and honest man wants for himself; nor such as he has any right to impose upon others. It is, to all moral intents and purposes, as destitute of obligation as the compacts which robbers and thieves and pirates enter into with each other, but never sign.\n\nIf any considerable number of the people believe the Constitution to be good, why do they not sign it themselves, and make laws for, and administer them upon, each other; leaving all other persons (who do not interfere with them) in peace? Until they have tried the experiment for themselves, how can they have the face to impose the Constitution upon, or even to recommend it to, others? Plainly the reason for such absurd and inconsistent conduct is that they want the Constitution, not solely for any honest or legitimate use it can be of to themselves or others, but for the dishonest and illegitimate power it gives them over the persons and properties of others. But for this latter reason, all their eulogiums on the Constitution, all their exhortations, and all their expenditures of money and blood to sustain it, would be wanting.\n\nVIII.\nThe Constitution itself, then, being of no authority, on what authority does our government practically rest? On what ground can those who pretend to administer it, claim the right to seize men‚Äôs property, to restrain them of their natural liberty of action, industry, and trade, and to kill all who deny their authority to dispose of men‚Äôs properties, liberties, and lives at their pleasure or discretion?\n\nThe most they can say, in answer to this question, is, that some half, two-thirds, or three-fourths of the male adults of the country have a tacit understanding that they will maintain a government under the Constitution; that they will select, by ballot, the persons to administer it; and that those persons who may receive a majority, or a plurality, of their ballots, shall act as their representatives, and administer the Constitution in their name, and by their authority.\n\nBut this tacit understanding (admitting it to exist) cannot at all justify the conclusion drawn from it. A tacit understanding between A, B, and C, that they will, by ballot, depute D as their agent, to deprive me of my property, liberty, or life, cannot at all authorize D to do so. He is none the less a robber, tyrant, and murderer, because he claims to act as their agent, than he would be if he avowedly acted on his own responsibility alone.\n\nNeither am I bound to recognize him as their agent, nor can he legitimately claim to be their agent, when he brings no written authority from them accrediting him as such. I am under no obligation to take his word as to who his principals may be, or whether he has any. Bringing no credentials, I have a right to say he has no such authority even as he claims to have: and that he is therefore intending to rob, enslave, or murder me on his own account.\n\nThis tacit understanding, therefore, among the voters of the country, amounts to nothing as an authority to their agents. Neither do the ballots by which they select their agents, avail any more than does their tacit understanding; for their ballots are given in secret, and therefore in a way to avoid any personal responsibility for the acts of their agents.\n\nNo body of men can be said to authorize a man to act as their agent, to the injury of a third person, unless they do it in so open and authentic a manner as to make themselves personally responsible for his acts. None of the voters in this country appoint their political agents in any open authentic manner, or in any manner to make themselves responsible for their acts. Therefore these pretended agents cannot legitimately claim to be really agents. Somebody must be responsible for the acts of these pretended agents; and if they cannot show any open and authentic credentials from their principals, they cannot, in law or reason, be said to have any principals. The maxim applies here, that what does not appear, does not exist. If they can show no principals, they have none.\n\nBut even these pretended agents do not themselves know who their pretended principals are. These latter act in secret; for acting by secret ballot is acting in secret as much as if they were to meet in secret conclave in the darkness of the night. And they are personally as much unknown to the agents they select, as they are to others. No pretended agent therefore can ever know by whose ballots he is selected, or consequently who his real principals are. Not knowing who his principals are, he has no right to say that he has any. He can, at most, say only that he is the agent of a secret band of robbers and murderers, who are bound by that faith which prevails among confederates in crime, to stand by him, if his acte, done in their name, shall be resisted.\n\nMen honestly engaged in attempting to establish justice in the world, have no occasion thus to act in secret; or to appoint agents to do acts for which they (the principals) are not willing to be responsible.\n\nThe secret ballot makes a secret government; and a secret government is a secret band of robbers and murderers. Open despotism is better than this. The single despot stands out in the face of all men, and says: I am the State: My will is law: I am your master: I take the responsibility of my acts: The only arbiter I acknowledge is the sword: If any one denies my right, let him try conclusions with me.\n\nBut a secret government is little less than a government of assassins. Under it, a man knows not who his tyrants are, until they have struck, and perhaps not then. He may guess, beforehand, as to some of his immediate neighbors. But he really knows nothing. The man to whom he would most naturally fly for protection, may prove an enemy, when the time of trial comes.\n\nThis is the kind of government we have; and it is the only one we are likely to have, until men are ready to say: We will consent to no Constitution, except such an one as we are neither ashamed nor afraid to sign; and we will authorize no government to do any thing in our name which we are not willing to be personally responsible for.\n\nIX.\nWhat is the motive to the secret ballot? This, and only this: Like other confederates in crime, those who use it are not friends, but enemies; and they are afraid to be known, and to have their individual doings known, even to each other. They can contrive to bring about a sufficient understanding to enable them to act in concert against other persons; but beyond this they have no confidence, and no friendship, among themselves. In fact, they are engaged quite as much in schemes for plundering each other, as in plundering those who are not of them. And it is perfectly well understood among them that the strongest party among them will, in certain contingencies, murder each other by the hundreds of thousands (as they lately did do) to accomplish their purposes against each other. Hence they dare not be known, and have their individual doings known, even to each other. And this is avowedly the only reason for the ballot: for a secret government; a government by secret bands of robbers and murderers. And we are insane enough to call this liberty! To be a member of this secret band of robbers and murderers is esteemed a privilege and an honor! Without this privilege, a man is considered a slave; but with it a free man! With it he is considered a free man, because he has the same power to secretly (by secret ballot) procure the robbery, enslavement, and murder of another man, that that other man has to procure his robbery, enslavement, and murder. And this they call equal rights!\n\nIf any number of men, many or few, claim the right to govern the people of this country, let them make and sign an open compact with each other to do so. Let them thus make themselves individually known to those whom they propose to govern. And let them thus openly take the legitimate responsibility of their acts. How many of those who now support the Constitution, will ever do this? How many will ever dare openly proclaim their right to govern? or take the legitimate responsibility of their acts? Not one!\n\nX.\nIt is obvious that, on general principles of law and reason, there exists no such thing as a government created by, or resting upon, any consent, compact, or agreement of ‚Äúthe people of the United States‚Äù with each other; that the only visible, tangible, responsible government that exists, is that of a few individuals only, who act in concert, and call themselves by the several names of senators, representatives, presidents, judges, marshals, treasurers, collectors, generals, colonels, captains, &c., &c.\n\nOn general principles of law and reason, it is of no importance whatever that these few individuals profess to be the agents and representatives of ‚Äúthe people of the United States‚Äù; since they can show no credentials from the people themselves; they were never appointed as agents or representatives in any open authentic manner; they do not themselves know, and have no means of knowing, and cannot prove, who their principals (as they call them) are individually; and consequently cannot, in law or reason, be said to have any principals at all.\n\nIt is obvious, too, that if these alleged principals ever did appoint these pretended agents, or representatives, they appointed them secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to avoid all personal responsibility for their acts; that, at most, these alleged principals put these pretended agents forward for the most criminal purposes, viz.: to plunder the people of their property, and restrain them of their liberty; and that the only authority that these alleged principals have for so doing, is simply a tacit understanding among themselves that they will imprison, shoot, or hang every man who resists the exactions and restraints which their agents or representatives may impose upon them.\n\nThus it is obvious that the only visible, tangible government we have is made up of these professed agents or representatives of a secret band of robbers and murderers, who, to cover up, or gloss over, their robberies and murders, have taken to themselves the title of ‚Äúthe people of the United States;‚Äù and who, on the pretence of being ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù assert their right to subject to their dominion, and to control and dispose of at their pleasure, all property and persons found in the United States.\n\nXI.\nOn general principles of law and reason, the oaths which these pretended agents of the people take ‚Äúto support the Constitution,‚Äù are of no validity or obligation. And why? For this, if for no other reason, viz. that they are given to nobody. There is no privity, (as the lawyers say),‚Äîthat is, no mutual recognition, consent and agreement‚Äîbetween those who take these oaths, and any other persons.\n\nIf I go upon Boston Common, and in the presence of a hundred thousand people, men, women and children, with whom I have no contract on the subject, take an oath that I will enforce upon them the laws of Moses, of Lycurgus, of Solon, of Justinian, or of Alfred, that oath is, on general principles of law and reason, of no obligation. It is of no obligation, not merely because it is intrinsically a criminal one, but also because it is given to nobody, and consequently pledges my faith to nobody. It is merely given to the winds.\n\nIt would not alter the case at all to say that, among these hundred thousand persons, in whose presence the oath was taken, there were two, three, or five thousand male adults, who had secretly‚Äîby secret ballot, and in a way to avoid making themselves individually known to me, or to the remainder of the hundred thousand‚Äîdesignated me as their agent to rule, control, plunder, and, if need be, murder, these hundred thousand people. The fact that they had designated me secretly, and in a manner to prevent my knowing them individually, prevents all privity between them and me; and consequently makes it impossible that there can be any contract, or pledge of faith, on my part towards them; for it is impossible that I can pledge my faith, in any legal sense, to a man whom I neither know, nor have any means of knowing, individually.\n\nSo far as I am concerned, then, these two, three, or five thousand persons are a secret band of robbers and murderers, who have secretly, and in a way to save themselves from all responsibility for my acts, designated me as their agent; and have, through some other agent, or pretended agent, made their wishes known to me. But being, nevertheless, individually unknown to me, and having no open, authentic contract with me, my oath is, on general principles of law and reason, of no validity as a pledge of faith to them. And being no pledge of faith to them, it is no pledge of faith to anybody. It is mere idle wind. At most, it is only a pledge of faith to an unknown band of robbers and murderers, whose instrument for plundering and murdering other people, I thus publicly confess myself to be. And it has no other obligation than a similar oath given to any other unknown body of pirates, robbers, and murderers.\n\nFor these reasons the oath taken by members of Congress, ‚Äúto support the Constitution,‚Äù are, on general principles of law and reason, of no validity. They are not only criminal in themselves, and therefore void; but they are also void for the further reason that they are given to nobody.\n\nIt cannot be said that, in any legitimate or legal sense, they are given to ‚Äúthe people of the United States;‚Äù because neither the whole, nor any large proportion of the whole, people of the United States ever, either openly or secretly, appointed or designated these men as their agents to carry the Constitution into effect. The great body of the people‚Äîthat is, men, women and children‚Äîwere never asked, or even permitted, to signify, in any formal manner, either openly or secretly, their choice or wish on the subject. The most that these members of Congress can say, in favor of their appointment, is simply this: Each one can say for himself:\n\nI have evidence satisfactory to myself, that there exists, scattered throughout the country, a band of men, having a tacit understanding with each other, and calling themselves ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù whose general purposes are to control and plunder each other, and all other persons in the country, and, so far as they can, even in neighboring countries; and to kill every man who shall attempt to defend his person and property against their schemes of plunder and dominion. Who these men are, individually, I have no certain means of knowing, for they sign no papers, and give no open, authentic evidence of their individual membership. They are not known individually even to each other. They are apparently as much afraid of being individually known to each other, as of being known to other persons. Hence they ordinarily have no mode either of exercising, or of making known, their individual membership, otherwise than by giving their votes secretly for certain agents to do their will. But although these men are individually unknown, both to each other and to other persons, it is generally understood in the country that none but male persons, of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, can be members. It is also generally understood that all male persons, born in the country, having certain complexions, and (in some localities) certain amounts of property, and (in certain cases) even persons of foreign birth, are permitted to be members. But it appears that usually not more than one-half, two-thirds, or, in some cases, three-fourths, of all who are thus permitted to become members of the band, ever exercise, or consequently prove, their actual membership, in the only mode in which they ordinarily can exercise or prove it, viz., by giving their votes secretly for the officers or agents of the band. The number of these secret votes, so far as we have any account of them, varies greatly from year to year, thus tending to prove that the band, instead of being a permanent organization, is a merely pro tempore affair with those who choose to act with it for the time being. The gross number of these secret votes, or what purports to be their gross number, in different localities, is occasionally published. Whether these reports are accurate or not, we have no means of knowing. It is generally supposed that great frauds are often committed in depositing them. They are understood to be received and counted by certain men, who are themselves appointed for that purpose by the same secret process by which all other officers and agents of the band are selected. According to the reports of these receivers of votes (for whose accuracy or honesty, however, I cannot vouch), and according to my best knowledge of the whole number of male persons ‚Äúin my district,‚Äù who (it is supposed) were permitted to vote, it would appear that one-half, two-thirds or three-fourths actually did vote. Who the men were, individually, who cast these votes, I have no knowledge, for the whole thing was done secretly. But of the secret votes thus given for what they call a ‚Äúmember of Congress,‚Äù the receivers reported that I had a majority, or at least a larger number than any other one person. And it is only by virtue of such a designation that I am now here to act in concert with other persons similarly selected in other parts of the country. It is understood among those who sent me here, that all the persons so selected, will, on coming together at the City of Washington, take an oath in each other‚Äôs presence ‚Äúto support the Constitution of the United States.‚Äù By this is meant a certain paper that was drawn up eighty years ago. It was never signed by anybody, and apparently has no obligation, and never had any obligation, as a contract. In fact, few persons ever read it, and doubtless much the largest number of those who voted for me and the others, never even saw it, or now pretend to know what it means. Nevertheless, it is often spoken of in the country as ‚Äúthe Constitution of the United States;‚Äù and for some reason or another, the men who sent me here, seem to expect that I, and all with whom I act, will swear to carry this Constitution into effect. I am therefore ready to take this oath, and to co-operate with all others, similarly selected, who are ready to take the same oath.\n\nThis is the most that any member of Congress can say in proof that he has any constituency; that he represents anybody; that his oath ‚Äúto support the Constitution,‚Äù is given to anybody, or pledges his faith to anybody. He has no open, written, or other authentic evidence, such as is required in all other cases, that he was ever appointed the agent or representative of anybody. He has no written power of attorney from any single individual. He has no such legal knowledge as is required in all other cases, by which he can identify a single one of those who pretend to have appointed him to represent them.\n\nOf course his oath, professedly given to them, ‚Äúto support the Constitution,‚Äù is, on general principles of law and reason, an oath given to nobody. It pledges his faith to nobody. If he fails to fulfil his oath, not a single person can come forward, and say to him, you have betrayed me, or broken faith with me.\n\nNo one can come forward and say to him: I appointed you my attorney to act for me. I required you to swear that, as my attorney, you would support the Constitution. You promised me that you would do so; and now you have forfeited the oath you gave to me. No single individual can say this.\n\nNo open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can come forward and say to him: We appointed you our attorney, to act for us. We required you to swear that, as our attorney, you would support the Constitution. You promised us that you would do so; and now you have forfeited the oath you gave to us.\n\nNo open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can say this to him; because there is no such association or body of men in existence. If any one should assert that there is such an association, let him prove, if he can, who compose it. Let him produce, if he can, any open, written, or other authentic contract, signed or agreed to by these men; forming themselves into an association; making themselves known as such to the world; appointing him as their agent; and making themselves individually, or as an association, responsible for his acts, done by their authority. Until all this can be shown, no one can say that, in any legitimate sense, there is any such association; or that he is their agent; or that he ever gave his oath to them; or ever pledged his faith to them.\n\nOn general principles of law and reason, it would be a sufficient answer for him to say, to all individuals, and all pretended associations of individuals, who should accuse him of a breach of faith to them:\n\nI never knew you. Where is your evidence that you, either individually or collectively, ever appointed me your attorney? that you ever required me to swear to you, that, as your attorney, I would support the Constitution? or that I have now broken any faith I ever pledged to you? You may, or you may not, be members of that secret band of robbers and murderers, who act in secret; appoint their agents by a secret ballot; who keep themselves individually unknown even to the agents they thus appoint; and who, therefore, cannot claim that they have any agents; or that any of their pretended agents ever gave his oath, or pledged his faith, to them. I repudiate you altogether. My oath was given to others, with whom you have nothing to do; or it was idle wind, given only to the idle winds. Begone!\n\nXII.\nFor the same reasons, the oaths of all the other pretended agents of this secret band of robbers and murderers are on general principles of law and reason, equally destitute of obligation. They are given to nobody; but only to the winds.\n\nThe oaths of the tax-gatherers and treasurers of the band, are, on general principles of law and reason, of no validity. If any tax gatherer, for example, should put the money he receives into his own pocket, and refuse to part with it, the members of this band could not say to him: You collected that money as our agent, and for our uses; and you swore to pay it over to us, or to those we should appoint to receive it. You have betrayed us, and broken faith with us.\n\nIt would be a sufficient answer for him to say to them:\n\nI never knew you. You never made yourselves individually known to me. I never gave my oath to you, as individuals. You may, or you may not, be members of that secret band, who appoint agents to rob and murder other people; but who are cautious not to make themselves individually known, either to such agents, or to those whom their agents are commissioned to rob. If you are members of that band, you have given me no proof of it, and you have no proof that you ever commissioned me to rob others for your benefit. I never knew you, as individuals, and of course never promised you that I would pay over to you the proceeds of my robberies. I committed my robberies on my own account, and for my own profit. If you thought I was fool enough to allow you to keep yourselves concealed, and use me as your tool for robbing other persons; or that I would take all the personal risk of the robberies, and pay over the proceeds to you, you were particularly simple. As I took all the risk of my robberies, I propose to take all the profits. Begone! You are fools, as well as villains. If I gave my oath to anybody, I gave it to other persons than you. But I really gave it to nobody. I only gave it to the winds. It answered my purposes at the time. It enabled me to get the money I was after, and now I propose to keep it. If you expected me to pay it over to you, you relied only upon that honor that is said to prevail among thieves. You now understand that that is a very poor reliance. I trust you may become wise enough to never rely upon it again. If I have any duty in the matter, it is to give back the money to those from whom I took it; not to pay it over to such villains as you.\n\nXIII.\nOn general principles of law and reason, the oaths which foreigners take, on coming here, and being ‚Äúnaturalized‚Äù (as it is called), are of no validity. They are necessarily given to nobody; because there is no open, authentic association, to which they can join themselves; or to whom, as individuals, they can pledge their faith. No such association, or organization, as ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù having ever been formed by any open, written, authentic, or voluntary contract, there is, on general principles of law and reason, no such association, or organization, in existence. And all oaths that purport to be given to such an association are necessarily given only to the winds. They cannot be said to be given to any man, or body of men, as individuals, because no man, or body of men, can come forward with any proof that the oaths were given to them, as individuals, or to any association of which they are members. To say that there is a tacit understanding among a portion of the male adults of the country, that they will call themselves ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù and that they will act in concert in subjecting the remainder of the people of the United States to their dominion; but that they will keep themselves personally concealed by doing all their acts secretly, is wholly insufficient, on general principles of law and reason, to prove the existence of any such association, or organization, as ‚Äúthe people of the United States;‚Äù or consequently to prove that the oaths of foreigners were given to any such association.\n\nXIV.\nOn general principles of law and reason, all the oaths which, since the war, have been given by Southern men, that they will obey the laws of Congress, support the Union, and the like, are of no validity. Such oaths are invalid, not only because they were extorted by military power, and threats of confiscation, and because they are in contravention of men‚Äôs natural right to do as they please about supporting the government, but also because they were given to nobody. They were nominally given to ‚Äúthe United States.‚Äù But being nominally given to ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù they were necessarily given to nobody, because, on general principles of law and reason, there were no ‚ÄúUnited States,‚Äù to whom the oaths could be given. That is to say, there was no open, authentic, avowed, legitimate association, corporation, or body of men, known as ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù or as ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù to whom the oaths could have been given. If anybody says there was such a corporation, let him state who were the individuals that composed it, and how and when they became a corporation. Were Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C members of it? If so, where are their signatures? Where the evidence of their membership? Where the record? Where the open, authentic proof? There is none. Therefore, in law and reason, there was no such corporation.\n\nOn general principles of law and reason, every corporation, association, or organized body of men, having a legitimate corporate existence, and legitimate corporate rights, must consist of certain known individuals, who can prove, by legitimate and reasonable evidence, their membership. But nothing of this kind can be proved in regard to the corporation, or body of men, who call themselves ‚Äúthe United States.‚Äù Not a man of them, in all the Northern States, can prove by any legitimate evidence, such as is required to prove membership in other legal corporations, that he himself, or any other man whom he can name, is a member of any corporation or association called ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù or, consequently, that there is any such corporation. And since no such corporation can be proved to exist, it cannot of course be proved that the oaths of Southern men were given to any such corporation. The most that can be claimed is that the oaths were given to a secret band of robbers and murderers, who called themselves ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù and extorted those oaths. But that certainly is not enough to prove that the oaths are of any obligation.\n\nXV.\nOn general principles of law and reason, the oaths of soldiers, that they will serve a given number of years, that they will obey the orders of their superior officers, that they will bear true allegiance to the government, and so forth, are of no obligation. Independently of the criminality of an oath, that, for a given number of years, he will kill all whom he may be commanded to kill, without exercising his own judgment or conscience as to the justice or necessity of such killing, there is this further reason why a soldier‚Äôs oath is of no obligation, viz. that, like all the other oaths that have now been mentioned, it is given to nobody. There being, in no legitimate sense, any such corporation, or nation, as ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù nor, consequently, in any legitimate sense, any such government as ‚Äúthe government of the United States,‚Äù a soldier‚Äôs oath given to, or contract made with, such nation or government, is necessarily an oath given to, or a contract made with, nobody. Consequently such oath or contract can be of no obligation.\n\nXVI.\nOn general principles of law and reason, the treaties, so called, which purport to be entered into with other nations, by certain persons calling themselves ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators of the United States, in the name, and on behalf, of ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù are of no validity. These so-called ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators, who claim to be the agents of ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù for making these treaties, can show no open, written, or other authentic evidence that either the whole ‚Äúpeople of the United States,‚Äù or any other open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretended ambassadors and others to make treaties in the name of, or binding upon any one of, ‚Äúthe people of the United States.‚Äù Neither can they show any open, written, or other authentic evidence that either the whole ‚Äúpeople of the United States,‚Äù or any other open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretended ambassadors, secretaries, and others, in their name and behalf, to recognize certain other persons, calling themselves emperors, kings, queens, and the like, as the rightful rulers, sovereigns, masters, or representatives of the different peoples whom they assume to govern, to represent, and to bind.\n\nThe ‚Äúnations,‚Äù as they are called, with whom our pretended ambassadors, secretaries, presidents and senators profess to make treaties, are as much myths as our own. On general principles of law and reason, there are no such ‚Äúnations.‚Äù That is to say, neither the whole people of England, for example, nor any open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name, ever, by any open, written, or other authentic contract with each other, formed themselves into any bona fide, legitimate association or organization, or authorized any king, queen, or other representative to make treaties in their name, or to bind them, either individually, or as an association, by such treaties.\n\nOur pretended treaties, then, being made with no legitimate or bona fide nations, or representatives of nations, and being made, on our part, by persons who have no legitimate authority to act for us, have intrinsically no more validity than a pretended treaty made by the Man in the Moon with the king of the Pleiades.\n\nXVII.\nOn general principles of law and reason, debts contracted in the name of ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù or of ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù are of no validity. It is utterly absurd to pretend that debts to the amount of twenty-five hundred millions of dollars are binding upon thirty-five or forty millions of people, when there is not a particle of legitimate evidence‚Äîsuch as would be required to prove a private debt‚Äîthat can be produced against any one of them, that either he, or his properly authorized attorney, ever contracted to pay one cent.\n\nCertainly, neither the whole people of the United States, nor any number of them, ever separately or individually contracted to pay a cent of these debts.\n\nCertainly, also, neither the whole people of the United States, nor any number of them, ever, by any open, written, or other authentic and voluntary contract, united themselves as a firm, corporation, or association, by the name of ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù and authorized their agents to contract debts in their name.\n\nCertainly, too, there is in existence no such firm, corporation, or association as ‚Äúthe United States,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù formed by any open, written, or other authentic and voluntary contract, and having corporate property with which to pay these debts.\n\nHow, then, is it possible, on any general principle of law or reason, that debts that are binding upon nobody individually, can be binding upon forty millions of people collectively, when, on general and legitimate principles of law and reason, these forty millions of people neither have, nor ever had, any corporate property? never made any corporate or individual contract? and neither have, nor ever had, any corporate existence?\n\nWho, then, created these debts, in the name of ‚Äúthe United States?‚Äù Why, at most, only a few persons, calling themselves ‚Äúmembers of Congress,‚Äù &c. who pretended to represent ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù but who really represented only a secret band of robbers and murderers, who wanted money to carry on the robberies and murders in which they were then engaged; and who intended to extort from the future people of the United States, by robbery and threats of murder (and real murder, if that should prove necessary), the means to pay these debts.\n\nThis band of robbers and murderers, who were the real principals in contracting these debts, is a secret one, because its members have never entered into any open, written, avowed, or authentic contract, by which they may be individually known to the world, or even to each other. Their real or pretended representatives, who contracted these debts in their name, were selected (if selected at all) for that purpose secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to furnish evidence against none of the principals individually; and these principals were really known individually neither to their pretended representatives who contracted these debts in their behalf, nor to those who lent the money. The money, therefore, was all borrowed and lent in the dark; that is, by men who did not see each other‚Äôs faces, or know each other‚Äôs names; who could not then, and cannot now, identify each other as principals in the transactions; and who consequently can prove no contract with each other.\n\nFurthermore, the money was all lent and borrowed for criminal purposes; that is, for purposes of robbery and murder; and for this reason the contracts were all intrinsically void; and would have been so, even though the real parties, borrowers and lenders, had come face to face, and made their contracts openly, in their own proper names.\n\nFurthermore, this secret band of robbers and murderers, who were the real borrowers of this money, having no legitimate corporate existence, have no corporate property with which to pay these debts. They do indeed pretend to own large tracts of wild lands, lying between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and between the Gulf of Mexico and the North Pole. But, on general principles of law and reason, they might as well pretend to own the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans themselves; or the atmosphere and the sunlight; and to hold them, and dispose of them, for the payment of these debts.\n\nHaving no corporate property with which to pay what purports to be their corporate debts, this secret band of robbers and murderers are really bankrupt. They have nothing to pay with. In fact, they do not propose to pay their debts otherwise than from the proceeds of their future robberies and murders. These are confessedly their sole reliance; and were known to be such by the lenders of the money, at the time the money was lent. And it was, therefore, virtually a part of the contract, that the money should be repaid only from the proceeds of these future robberies and murders. For this reason, if for no other, the contracts were void from the beginning.\n\nIn fact, these apparently two classes, borrowers and lenders, were really one and the same class. They borrowed and lent money from and to themselves. They themselves were not only part and parcel, but the very life and soul, of this secret band of robbers and murderers, who borrowed and spent the money. Individually they furnished money for a common enterprise; taking, in return, what purported to be corporate promises for individual loans. The only excuse they had for taking these so-called corporate promises of, for individual loans by, the same parties, was that they might have some apparent excuse for the future robberies of the band (that is, to pay the debts of the corporation), and that they might also know what shares they were to be respectively entitled to out of the proceeds of their future robberies.\n\nFinally, if these debts had been created for the most innocent and honest purposes, and in the most open and honest manner, by the real parties to the contracts, these parties could thereby have bound nobody but themselves, and no property but their own. They could have bound nobody that should have come after them, and no property subsequently created by, or belonging to, other persons.\n\nXVIII.\nThe Constitution having never been signed by anybody; and there being no other open, written, or authentic contract between any parties whatever, by virtue of which the United States government, so called, is maintained; and it being well known that none but male persons, of twenty-one years of age and upwards, are allowed any voice in the government; and it being also well known that a large number of these adult persons seldom or never vote at all; and that all those who do vote, do so secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to prevent their individual votes being known, either to the world, or even to each other; and consequently in a way to make no one openly responsible for the acts of their agents, or representatives,‚Äîall these things being known, the questions arise: Who compose the real governing power in the country? Who are the men, the responsible men, who rob us of our property? Restrain us of our liberty? Subject us to their arbitrary dominion? And devastate our homes, and shoot us down by the hundreds of thousands, if we resist? How shall we find these men? How shall we know them from others? How shall we defend ourselves and our property against them? Who, of our neighbors, are members of this secret band of robbers and murderers? How can we know which are their houses, that we may burn or demolish them? Which their property, that we may destroy it? Which their persons, that we may kill them, and rid the world and ourselves of such tyrants and monsters?\n\nThese are questions that must be answered, before men can be free; before they can protect themselves against this secret band of robbers and murderers, who now plunder, enslave, and destroy them.\n\nThe answer to these questions is, that only those who have the will and the power to shoot down their fellow men, are the real rulers in this, as in all other (so called) civilized countries; for by no others will civilized men be robbed, or enslaved.\n\nAmong savages, mere physical strength, on the part of one man, may enable him to rob, enslave, or kill another man. Among barbarians, mere physical strength, on the part of a body of men, disciplined, and acting in concert, though with very little money or other wealth, may, under some circumstances, enable them to rob, enslave, or kill another body of men, as numerous, or perhaps even more numerous, than themselves. And among both savages and barbarians, mere want may sometimes compel one man to sell himself as a slave to another. But with (so called) civilized peoples, among whom knowledge, wealth, and the means of acting in concert, have become diffused; and who have invented such weapons and other means of defence as to render mere physical strength of less importance; and by whom soldiers in any requisite number, and other instrumentalities of war in any requisite amount, can always be had for money, the question of war, and consequently the question of power, is little else than a mere question of money. As a necessary consequence, those who stand ready to furnish this money, are the real rulers. It is so in Europe, and it is so in this country.\n\nIn Europe, the nominal rulers, the emperors and kings and parliaments, are anything but the real rulers of their respective countries. They are little or nothing else than mere tools, employed by the wealthy to rob, enslave, and (if need be) murder those who have less wealth, or none at all.\n\nThe Rothschilds, and that class of money-lenders of whom they are the representatives and agents,‚Äîmen who never think of lending a shilling to their next-door neighbors, for purposes of honest industry, unless upon the most ample security, and at the highest rate of interest,‚Äîstand ready, at all times, to lend money in unlimited amounts to those robbers and murderers, who call themselves governments, to be expended in shooting down those who do not submit quietly to being robbed and enslaved.\n\nThey lend their money in this manner, knowing that it is to be expended in murdering their fellow men, for simply seeking their liberty and their rights; knowing also that neither the interest nor the principal will ever be paid, except as it will be extorted under terror of the repetition of such murders as those for which the money lent is to be expended.\n\nThese money-lenders, the Rothschilds, for example, say to themselves: If we lend a hundred millions sterling to the Queen and Parliament of England, it will enable them to murder twenty, fifty, or a hundred thousand people in England, Ireland, or India; and the terror inspired by such wholesale murder, will enable them to keep the whole people of those countries in subjection for twenty, or perhaps fifty, years to come; to control all their trade and industry; and to extort from them large amounts of money, under the name of taxes; and from the wealth thus extorted from them, they (the Queen and Parliament) can afford to pay us a higher rate of interest for our money than we can get in any other way. Or, if we lend this sum to the Emperor of Austria, it will enable him to murder so many of his people as to strike terror into the rest, and thus enable him to keep them in subjection, and extort money from them, for twenty or fifty years to come. And they say the same in regard to the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Emperor of France, or any other ruler, so called, who, in their judgment, will be able, by murdering a reasonable portion of his people, to keep the rest in subjection, and extort money from them, for a long time to come, to pay the interest and principal of the money lent him.\n\nAnd why are these men so ready to lend money for murdering their fellow men? Solely for this reason, viz., that such loans are considered better investments than loans for purposes of honest industry. They pay higher rates of interest; and it is less trouble to look after them. This is the whole matter.\n\nThe question of making these loans is, with these lenders, a mere question of pecuniary profit. They lend money to be expended in robbing, enslaving, and murdering their fellow men, solely because, on the whole, such loans pay better than any others. They are no respecters of persons, no superstitious fools, that reverence monarchs. They care no more for a king, or an emperor, than they do for a beggar, except as he is a better customer, and can pay them better interest for their money. If they doubt his ability to make his murders successful for maintaining his power, and thus extorting money from his people in future, they dismiss him as unceremoniously as they would dismiss any other hopeless bankrupt, who should want to borrow money to save himself from open insolvency.\n\nWhen these great lenders of blood-money, like the Rothschilds, have loaned vast sums in this way, for purposes of murder, to an emperor or a king, they sell out the bonds taken by them, in small amounts, to anybody, and everybody, who are disposed to buy them at satisfactory prices, to hold as investments. They (the Rothschilds) thus soon get back their money, with great profits; and are now ready to lend money in the same way again to any other robber and murderer, called an emperor or a king, who, they think, is likely to be successful in his robberies and murders, and able to pay a good price for the money necessary to carry them on.\n\nThis business of lending blood-money is one of the most thoroughly sordid, cold-blooded and criminal that was ever carried on, to any considerable extent, amongst human beings. It is like lending money to slave-traders, or to common robbers and pirates, to be repaid out of their plunder. And the men who loan money to governments, so called, for the purpose of enabling the latter to rob, enslave, and murder their people, ar among the greatest villains that the world has ever seen. And they as much deserve to be hunted and killed (if they cannot otherwise be got rid of) as any slave-traders, robbers, or pirates that ever lived.\n\nWhen these emperors and kings, so called, have obtained their loans, they proceed to hire and train immense numbers of professional murderers, called soldiers, and employ them in shooting down all who resist their demands for money. In fact, most of them keep large bodies of these murderers constantly in their service, as their only means of enforcing their extortions. There are now, I think, four or five millions of these professional murderers constantly employed by the so-called sovereigns of Europe. The enslaved people are, of course, forced to support and pay all these murderers, as well as to submit to all the other extortions which these murderers are employed to enforce.\n\nIt is only in this way that most of the so-called governments of Europe are maintained. These so-called governments are in reality only great bands of robbers and murderers, organized, disciplined, and constantly on the alert. And the so-called sovereigns, in these different governments, are simply the heads, or chiefs, of different bands of robbers and murderers. And these heads or chiefs are dependent upon the lenders of blood-money for the means to carry on their robberies and murders. They could not sustain themselves a moment but for the loans made to them by these blood-money loan-mongers. And their first care is to maintain their credit with them; for they know their end is come, the instant their credit with them fails. Consequently the first proceeds of their extortions are scrupulously applied to the payment of the interest on their loans.\n\nIn addition to paying the interest on their bonds, they perhaps grant to the holders of them great monopolies in banking, like the Banks of England, of France, and of Vienna; with the agreement that these banks shall furnish money whenever, in sudden emergencies, it may be necessary to shoot down more of their people. Perhaps also, by means of tariffs on competing imports, they give great monopolies to certain branches of industry, in which these lenders of blood-money are engaged. They also, by unequal taxation, exempt wholly or partially the property of these loan-mongers, and throw corresponding burdens upon those who are too poor and weak to resist.\n\nThus it is evident that all these men, who call themselves by the high-sounding names of Emperors, Kings, Sovereigns, Monarchs, Most Christian Majesties, Most Catholic Majesties, High Mightinesses, Most Serene and Potent Princes, and the like, and who claim to rule ‚Äúby the grace of God,‚Äù by ‚ÄúDivine Right,‚Äù‚Äîthat is, by special authority from Heaven,‚Äîare intrinsically not only the merest miscreants and wretches, engaged solely in plundering, enslaving, and murdering their fellow men, but that they are also the merest hangers on, the servile, obsequious, fawning dependents and tools of these blood-money loan-mongers, on whom they rely for the means to carry on their crimes. These loan-mongers, like the Rothschilds, laugh in their sleeves, and say to themselves: These despicable creatures, who call themselves emperors, and kings, and majesties, and most serene and potent princes; who profess to wear crowns, and sit on thrones; who deck themselves with ribbons, and feathers, and jewels; and surround themselves with hired flatterers and lickspittles; and whom we suffer to strut around, and palm themselves off, upon fools and slaves, as sovereigns and lawgivers specially appointed by Almighty God; and to hold themselves out as the sole fountains of honors, and dignities, and wealth, and power,‚Äîall these miscreants and impostors know that we make them, and use them; that in us they live, move, and have their being; that we require them (as the price of their positions) to take upon themselves all the labor, all the danger, and all the odium of all the crimes they commit for our profit; and that we will unmake them, strip them of their gewgaws, and send them out into the world as beggars, or give them over to the vengeance of the people they have enslaved, the moment they refuse to commit any crime we require of them, or to pay over to us such share of the proceeds of their robberies as we see fit to demand.\n\nXIX.\nNow, what is true in Europe, is substantially true in this country. The difference is the immaterial one, that, in this country, there is no visible, permanent head, or chief, of these robbers and murderers, who call themselves ‚Äúthe government.‚Äù That is to say, there is no one man, who calls himself the state, or even emperor, king, or sovereign; no one who claims that he and his children rule ‚Äúby the Grace of God,‚Äù by ‚ÄúDivine Right,‚Äù or by special appointment from Heaven. There are only certain men, who call themselves presidents, senators, and representatives, and claim to be the authorized agents, for the time being, or for certain short periods, of all ‚Äúthe people of the United States;‚Äù but who can show no credentials, or powers of attorney, or any other open, authentic evidence that they are so; and who notoriously are not so; but are really only the agents of a secret band of robbers and murderers, whom they themselves do not know, and have no means of knowing, individually; but who, they trust, will openly or secretly, when the crisis comes, sustain them in all their usurpations and crimes.\n\nWhat is important to be noticed is, that these so-called presidents, senators, and representatives, these pretended agents of all ‚Äúthe people of the United States,‚Äù the moment their exactions meet with any formidable resistance from any portion of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù themselves, are obliged, like their co-robbers and murderers in Europe, to fly at once to the lenders of blood money, for the means to sustain their power. And they borrow their money on the same principle, and for the same purpose, viz., to be expended in shooting down all those ‚Äúpeople of the United States‚Äù‚Äîtheir own constituents and principals, as they profess to call them‚Äîwho resist the robberies and enslavement which these borrowers of the money are practising upon them. And they expect to repay the loans, if at all, only from the proceeds of the future robberies, which they anticipate it will be easy for them and their successors to perpetrate through a long series of years, upon their pretended principals, if they can but shoot down now some hundreds of thousands of them, and thus strike terror into the rest.\n\nPerhaps the facts were never made more evident, in any country on the globe, than in our own, that these soulless blood-money loan-mongers are the real rulers; that they rule from the most sordid and mercenary motives; that the ostensible government, the presidents, senators, and representatives, so-called, are merely their tools; and that no ideas of, or regard for, justice or liberty had anything to do in inducing them to lend their money for the war. In proof of all this, look at the following facts.\n\nNearly a hundred years ago we professed to have got rid of all that religious superstition, inculcated by a servile and corrupt priesthood in Europe, that rulers, so called, derived their authority directly from Heaven; and that it was consequently a religious duty on the part of the people to obey them. We professed long ago to have learned that governments could rightfully exist only by the free will, and on the voluntary support, of those who might choose to sustain them. We all professed to have known long ago, that the only legitimate objects of government were the maintenance of liberty and justice equally for all. All this we had professed for nearly a hundred years. And we professed to look with pity and contempt upon those ignorant, superstitious, and enslaved peoples of Europe, who were so easily kept in subjection by the frauds and force of priests and kings.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, that we had learned, and known, and professed, for nearly a century, these lenders of blood money had, for a long series of years previous to the war, been the willing accomplices of the slave-holders in perverting the government from the purposes of liberty and justice, to the greatest of crimes. They had been such accomplices for a purely pecuniary consideration, to wit, a control of the markets in the South; in other words, the privilege of holding the slave-holders them-selves in industrial and commercial subjection to the manufacturers and merchants of the North (who afterwards furnished the money for the war). And these Northern merchants and manufacturers, these lenders of blood-money, were willing to continue to be the accomplices of the slave-holders in the future, for the same pecuniary consideration. But the slave-holders, either doubting the fidelity of their Northern allies, or feeling themselves strong enough to keep their slaves in subjection without Northern assistance, would no longer pay the price which these Northern men demanded. And it was to enforce this price in the future‚Äîthat is, to monopolize the Southern markets, to maintain their industrial and commercial control over the South‚Äîthat these Northern manufacturers and merchants lent some of the profits of their former monopolies for the war, in order to secure to themselves the same, or greater, monopolies in the future. These‚Äîand not any love of liberty or justice‚Äîwere the motives on which the money for the war was lent by the North. In short, the North said to the slave-holders: If you will not pay us our price (give us control of your markets) for our assistance against your slaves, we will secure the same price (keep control of your markets) by helping your slaves against you, and using them as our tools for maintaining dominion over you; for the control of your markets we will have, whether the tools we use for that purpose be black or white, and be the cost, in blood and money, what it may.\n\nOn this principle, and from this motive, and not from any love of liberty or justice, the money was lent in enormous amounts, and at enormous rates of interest. And it was only by means of these loans that the objects of the war were accomplished.\n\nAnd now these lenders of blood-money demand their pay; and the government, so called, becomes their tool, their servile, slavish, villanous tool, to extort it from the labor of the enslaved people both of the North and the South. It is to be extorted by every form of direct, and indirect, and unequal taxation. Not only the nominal debt and interest‚Äîenormous as the latter was‚Äîare to be paid in full; but these holders of the debt are to be paid still further‚Äîand perhaps doubly, triply, or quadruply paid‚Äîby such tariffs on imports as will enable our home manufacturers to realize enormous prices for their commodities; also by such monopolies in banking as will enable them to keep control of, and thus enslave and plunder, the industry and trade of the great body of the Northern people themselves. In short, the industrial and commercial slavery of the great body of the people, North and South, black and white, is the price which these-lenders of blood money demand, and insist upon, and are determined to secure, in return for the money lent for the war.\n\nThis programme having been fully arranged and systematized, they put their sword into the hands of the chief murderer of the war, and charge him to carry their scheme into effect. And now he, speaking as their organ, says: ‚ÄúLet us have peace.‚Äù\n\nThe meaning of this is: Submit quietly to all the robbery and slavery we have arranged for you, and you can have ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù But in case you resist, the same lenders of blood-money, who furnished the means to subdue the South, will furnish the means again to subdue you.\n\nThese are the terms on which alone this government, or, with few exceptions, any other, ever gives ‚Äúpeace‚Äù to its people.\n\nThe whole affair, on the part of those who furnished the money, has been, and now is, a deliberate scheme of robbery and murder; not merely to monopolize the markets of the South, but also to monopolize the currency, and thus control the industry and trade, and thus plunder and enslave the laborers, of both North and South. And Congress and the president are to-day the merest tools for these purposes. They are obliged to be, for they know that their own power, as rulers, so called, is at an end, the moment their credit with the blood-money loan-mongers fails. They are like a bankrupt in the hands of an extortioner. They dare not say nay to any demand made upon them. And to hide at once, if possible, both their servility and their crimes, they attempt to divert public attention, by crying out that they have ‚ÄúAbolished Slavery!‚Äù That they have ‚ÄúSaved the Country!‚Äù That they have ‚ÄúPreserved our Glorious Union!‚Äù and that, in now paying the ‚ÄúNational Debt,‚Äù as they call it (as if the people themselves, all of them who are to be taxed for its payment, had really and voluntarily joined in contracting it), they are simply ‚ÄúMaintaining the National Honor!‚Äù\n\nBy ‚Äúmaintaining the national honor,‚Äù they mean simply that they themselves, open robbers and murderers, assume to be the nation, and will keep faith with those who lend them the money necessary to enable them to crush the great body of the people under their feet; and will faithfully appropriate, from the proceeds of their future robberies and murders, enough to pay all their loans, principal and interest.\n\nThe pretence that the ‚Äúabolition of slavery‚Äù was either a motive or justification for the war, is a fraud of the same character with that of ‚Äúmaintaining the national honor.‚Äù Who, but such usurpers, robbers, and murderers as they, ever established slavery? Or what government, except one resting upon the sword, like the one we now have, was ever capable of maintaining slavery? And why did these men abolish slavery? Not from any love of liberty in general‚Äînot as an act of justice to the black man himself, but only ‚Äúas a war measure,‚Äù and because they wanted his assistance, and that of his friends, in carrying on the war they had undertaken for maintaining and intensifying that political, commercial, and industrial slavery, to which they have subjected the great body of the people, both white and black. And yet these impostors now cry out that they have abolished the chattel slavery of the black man‚Äîalthough that was not the motive of the war‚Äîas if they thought they could thereby conceal, atone for, or justify that other slavery which they were fighting to perpetuate, and to render more rigorous and inexorable than it ever was before. There was no difference of principle‚Äîbut only of degree‚Äîbetween the slavery they boast they have abolished, and the slavery they were fighting to preserve; for all restraints upon men‚Äôs natural liberty, not necessary for the simple maintenance of justice, are of the nature of slavery, and differ from each other only in degree.\n\nIf their object had really been to abolish slavery, or maintain liberty or justice generally, they had only to say: All, whether white or black, who want the protection of this government, shall have it; and all who do not want it, will be left in peace, so long as they leave us in peace. Had they said this, slavery would necessarily have been abolished at once; the war would have been saved; and a thousand times nobler union than we have ever had would have been the result. It would have been a voluntary union of free men; such a union as will one day exist among all men, the world over, if the several nations, so called, shall ever get rid of the usurpers, robbers, and murderers, called governments, that now plunder, enslave, and destroy them.\n\nStill another of the frauds of these men is, that they are now establishing, and that the war was designed to establish, ‚Äúa government of consent.‚Äù The only idea they have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this‚Äîthat it is one to which everybody must consent, or be shot. This idea was the dominant one on which the war was carried on; and it is the dominant one, now that we have got what is called ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù\n\nTheir pretences that they have ‚ÄúSaved the Country,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPreserved our Glorious Union,‚Äù are frauds like all the rest of their pretences. By them they mean simply that they have subjugated, and maintained their power over, an unwilling people. This they call ‚ÄúSaving the Country;‚Äù as if an enslaved and subjugated people‚Äîor as if any people kept in subjection by the sword (as it is intended that all of us shall be hereafter)‚Äîcould be said to have any country. This, too, they call ‚ÄúPreserving our Glorious Union;‚Äù as if there could be said to be any Union, glorious or inglorious, that was not voluntary. Or as if there could be said to be any union between masters and slaves; between those who conquer, and those who are subjugated.\n\nAll these cries of having ‚Äúabolished slavery,‚Äù of having ‚Äúsaved the country,‚Äù of having ‚Äúpreserved the union,‚Äù of establishing ‚Äúa government of consent,‚Äù and of ‚Äúmaintaining the national honor,‚Äù are all gross, shameless, transparent cheats‚Äîso transparent that they ought to decieve no one‚Äîwhen uttered as justifications for the war, or for the government that has succeeded the war, or for now compelling the people to pay the cost of the war, or for compelling anybody to support a government that he does not want.\n\nThe lesson taught by all these facts is this: As long as mankind continue to pay ‚ÄúNational Debts,‚Äù so-called,‚Äîthat is, so long as they are such dupes and cowards as to pay for being cheated, plundered, enslaved, and murdered,‚Äîso long there will be enough to lend the money for those purposes; and with that money a plenty of tools, called soldiers, can be hired to keep them in subjection. But when they refuse any longer to pay for being thus cheated, plundered, enslaved, and murdered, they will cease to have cheats, and usurpers, and robbers, and murderers and blood-money loan-mongers for masters.\n\nAPPENDIX.\nInasmuch as the Constitution was never signed, nor agreed to, by anybody, as a contract, and therefore never bound anybody, and is now binding upon nobody; and is, moreover, such an one as no people can ever hereafter be expected to consent to, except as they may be forced to do so at the point of the bayonet, it is perhaps of no importance what its true legal meaning, as a contract, is. Nevertheless, the writer thinks it proper to say that, in his opinion, the Constitution is no such instrument as it has generally been assumed to be; but that by false interpretations, and naked usurpations, the government has been made in practice a very widely, and almost wholly, different thing from what the Constitution itself purports to authorize. He has heretofore written much, and could write much more, to prove that such is the truth. But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain‚Äîthat it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.\n\nSuppose it be ‚Äúthe best government on earth,‚Äù does that prove its own goodness, or only the badness of all other governments?\n\nThe very men who drafted it, never signed it in any way to bind themselves by it, as a contract. And not one of them probably ever would have signed it in any way to bind himself by it, as a contract.\n\nI have personally examined the statute books of the following States, viz.: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indians, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Nevada, California, and Oregon, and find that in all these States the English statute has been re-enacted, sometimes with modifications, but generally enlarging its operations, and is now in force.\n\nThe following are some of the provisions of the Massachusetts statute:\n\n‚ÄúNo action shall be brought in any of the following cases, that is to say: . . . .\n\n‚ÄúTo charge a person upon a special promise to answer for the debt, default, or misdoings of another: . . . .\n\n‚ÄúUpon a contract for the sale of lands, tenements, hereditaments, or of any interest in, or concerning them; or\n\n‚ÄúUpon an agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the writing thereof:\n\n‚ÄúUnless the promise, contract, or agreement, upon which such action is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by some person thereunto by him awfully authorized: . . . .\n\n‚ÄúNo contract for the sale of goods, wares, or merchandise, for the price of fifty dollars or more, shall be good or valid, unless the purchaser accepts and receives part of the goods so sold, or gives something in earnest to bind the bargain, or in part payment; or unless some note or memorandum in writing of the bargain is made and signed by the party to be charged thereby, or by some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.‚Äù\n\nAnd this two-thirds vote may be but two-thirds of a quorum‚Äîthat is two-thirds of a majority‚Äîinstead of two-thirds of the whole.\n\nOf what appreciable value is it to any man, as an individual, that he is allowed a voice in choosing these public masters? His voice is only one of several millions.",

Anyone can duplicate, modify, and create their own version of it. This has led to countless altcoins trying to replicate Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary properties or exploring other use cases.\n\nNo, Bitcoin cannot truly be copied because its core value lies in its network effect, global consensus, and historical significance. Bitcoin is the first-ever functioning digital money, solving the problem of digital scarcity. This ‚Äúfirst-mover‚Äù status is as irreplaceable as humanity‚Äôs first moon landing‚Äîyou can‚Äôt recreate the first.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs organic 16-year growth, fair launch (no pre-mine or central control), and decentralized trust make it unique.

But even before we could ask, the community stepped up to help‚Äîthank you!\n\nMany freedom software warriors may remember the time when we couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for servers, and our hosting provider shut them all down. That day, Wasabi almost died. We had to focus on reducing resource consumption to keep the backend and coordinator alive. Since then, we‚Äôve been running the Wasabi backend on a tiny server that has been pushed to its limits serving all users.\n\nBut Wasabi users are among the hardest Bitcoiners, and they have decided that Wasabi must survive. Thank you again to our donors, to those who continued contributing their time and knowledge for free, to all coordinator operators for putting skin in the game, to everyone integrating WabiSabi into their projects, and to all our users who support Wasabi and keep our morale high.\n\nYour support keeps Wasabi alive!",

    "content": "How Austrian School Economists Crushed Karl Marx‚Äôs Socialism\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£  Ludwig von Mises and the Economic Calculation Problem\n\nBeyond Incentives: Mises argued that the fundamental flaw in socialism isn‚Äôt just the lack of incentives to work hard or perform undesirable tasks but the inability of central planners to make rational economic decisions.\n\nAbsence of Prices: He highlighted that without private ownership of the means of production, there could be no genuine market, no price formation, and thus no way to calculate profits and losses. This makes rational economic planning impossible.\n\nInevitability of Chaos: Mises concluded that without market prices, central planning leads to arbitrary, chaotic decisions and the irrational allocation of resources, resulting in widespread shortages and the collapse of the planned economy.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£  F.A. Hayek and The Knowledge Problem\n\nDispersed Knowledge: Hayek demonstrated that in the real world, information is dispersed among countless individuals, making it impossible for central planners to possess the specific knowledge needed to manage an economy.\n\nSpontaneous Order: He argued that only individuals with localized knowledge can coordinate supply and demand effectively through a price system.\n\nLimitations of Central Planning: Hayek highlighted that central planning is not only presumptuous but also harmful, as it prevents those with the necessary information from making optimal decisions. The market‚Äôs price system functions as a ‚Äútelecommunication network,‚Äù efficiently transmitting knowledge without bureaucratic interference.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£  Carl Menger and Subjective Value\n\nSubjective Value: Menger refuted Marx‚Äôs labor theory of value by showing that a good‚Äôs value is subjective and determined by individual utility, not the amount of labor invested.\n\nLabor Doesn‚Äôt Create Value: He argued that labor alone doesn‚Äôt give value to a product; the value depends on whether someone finds the product useful and is willing to pay for it.\n\nDiminishing Marginal Utility: Menger introduced the concept that the value of additional identical goods decreases as their quantity increases, further challenging Marx‚Äôs idea that value is tied solely to labor.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Eugen B√∂hm-Bawerk and Time Preference\n\nSurplus Value Debunked: B√∂hm-Bawerk refuted Marx‚Äôs idea that capitalists exploit workers by underpaying them, emphasizing that wages reflect the time preference of present goods over future profits.\n\nTime Preference: He introduced the concept of time preference, where capitalists advance wages (present goods) in exchange for future goods (profits), accounting for risk and waiting time.\n\nWage Differences: The wage difference isn‚Äôt exploitation but a fair trade of present wages for future profits, with workers receiving immediate compensation and avoiding future risks.\n\n‚úíÔ∏è:  Students for Liberty\nhttps://m.primal.net/NHdE.jpg",

    "content": "I am about to give you three links instead of one. I recommend starting by reading this readme:\n\nhttps://github.com/supertestnet/hurricash\n\nI think it is the simplest way to begin to understand how my channel factory works. While implementing that, I figured out a way to solve its principal problem, which is that the way \"withdrawal transactions\" work in hurricash does not allow users to know the txid of their \"withdrawal utxo\" in advance. Having figured out a solution, I created Tornado Factory: https://github.com/supertestnet/tornado_factory\n\nI recommend reading that readme because it tells how I solve hurricash's problem. Also, play with the implementation! It calls itself a channel factory, but it doesn't actually produce channels; each user only gets a withdrawal utxo whose txid and amount they know in advance.\n\nLastly, there is Hedgehog Factory: https://github.com/supertestnet/hedgehog_factory\n\nThat doesn't have a readme yet, but it is a WIP attempt to improve Tornado Factory in three ways:\n\n(1) it has real, usable channels now, not just a random utxo you get to withdraw (though the channels are currently receive-only)\n\n(2) users can run the app separately now and coordinate over the internet to do the funding transaction (in Tornado Factory, all users are just different pubkeys generated by the same page, so it's really just one user with n pubkeys)\n\n(3) I implemented a massive efficiency gain by delegating *one* person to do the funding transaction and having everyone else *pay him over lightning* as a kind of admission-fee to the pool. This makes it so that n channels are opened with a single transaction needing only one input and two outputs (the multisig and some change).\n\nThis greatly reduces the cost of channel opens *and* gives people an opportunity to make money on their bitcoin. E.g. if a btc transaction costs $10, you can make money on your bitcoin offering more than 10 people the opportunity to open a channel in a pool where you are the delegate, and then you just charge each person a $1 admission fee. Everyone wins: you make money, and they each get a channel for $1 that would have costed them $10 otherwise.\n\nSo that's what I'm currently building in Hedgehog Factory: a tool where you can invite people to enter a pool where you perform the funding transaction and charge an \"admission fee\" to recoup your costs and hopefully make something extra.",

    "content": "I am excited, my channel factory implementation is making great progress! I got \"receiving\" to work today -- which is the hard part. Right now I am working on making it so users can also \"send\" money from their off-chain channels.\n\nOnce that is done, it won't just be a channel factory, it will also count as a coinpool: n users share a utxo locked to an n-of-n multisig, and any member can spend money from it on LN (because it's a channel factory) OR on the base layer via an LN-to-base-layer swap.\n\nif any member chooses the latter, a transaction will appear on the base layer that an analyst might be able to trace to the pool (if the swapper colludes, along with all routing nodes from the pool to the swapper), but they can't trace it any further. Nothing on the blockchain tells who's who in the pool, and not even the channel counterparties know who's who in the pool.\n\nhopefully this will help fix two problems with LN: the sometimes-high cost of creating a channel and the privacy drawback of putting your channel-opening transaction on the base layer",

This approach has important tradeoffs that I'm thinking how to present to the user.

    "content": "##  What is a TollGate?\nTollGate is a set of tools that enables WiFi routers to accept Bitcoin payments for internet access. This allows anyone with suitable hardware and an internet gateway to operate as an internet service provider.\n\n## What is nostr?\n[Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple yet powerful decentralised protocol that enables seamless JSON based communication between public keys through relay servers. In the context of TollGate, nostr serves as the perfect foundation for handling WiFi access payments by eliminating the need for traditional captive portals and providing instant, reliable connections through websocket technology. The protocol's relay-based architecture reduces common firewall issues while offering standardised payment methods. Its flexible nature means components can be deployed almost anywhere with minimal configuration, making it ideal for TollGate operators to set up and developers to maintain their services.\n\n### What are the hardware requirements?\nA TollGate must have at least two network interfaces. One interface connects to an internet gateway, while the other interface acts as a WiFi access point for users or other TollGates. Each TollGate runs its own DHCP server with a unique address range to avoid collisions with its gateway or its clients (who could also be running a DHCP server). Hence, each TollGate is a stand-alone system from a networking perspective. Finally, each TollGate has gate-keeping logic that manages firewall rules for allowing clients to access the internet gateway once they have paid and to cut them off again when their session ends.\n\nCurrently we are targeting [GL-AR300m](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ar300m/), [GL-MT300](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=menubar) and [GL-MT600](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt6000/) because they come with `uboot` for system recovery and they support OpenWRT out of the box.\n\n### TollGate's New Architecture\nPreviously we used WiFi captive portals like [nodogsplash](https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash) and [OpenNDS](https://github.com/openNDS/openNDS) for managing access to the internet gateway. These captive portals allowed us to quickly build a proof of concept. However, both captive portals came with severe UX and maintainability limitations - see [limitations of captive portals](#benefits-of-using-crows-nest-over-captive-portal).\n\nA key benefit of building on `nostr` is that `services` can generate their own public key based identity (`npub`) in order to send and receive `json` content from other services as long as they have an outbound internet connection that can connect to public IP addresses. Nostr abstracts away the networking layer entirely, so developers don't need to think about things like firewalls, IP-addresses, ports and network boundaries.\n\nThanks to recent success that @origami74 had in running a nostr [relay](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru) and a [client](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-valve-go) on the GL-AR300m, we are now able to build in ways that we could only have dreamt of before. \n\nThis figure illustrates the modules that TollGate is now comprised of:\n![TollGate Modules](https://opentollgate.github.io/tollgate/tollgate_modules.jpeg)\n\nAnd this sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the services:\n![TollGate Sequence Diagram](https://opentollgate.github.io/tollgate/tollgate-sequence-diagram.png)\n\n\nTollGate is now comprised of three main types of services and a relay:\n\n* **Crows Nest:** scans for available WiFi access points in search of gateways that are worth connecting to. Upon finding a suitable gateway, the crows nest rotates this devices `MAC address` and `npub` (for privacy), connects to the WiFi access point and submits a `payment event` if required.\n* **Valve:** manages access to the internet gateway. Currently the valve is just a `nostr` wrapper around a CLI tool called [ndsctl](https://opennds.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ndsctl.html) for managing user sessions in captive portals. Thanks to the fact that the valve now has an `npub`, it can be controlled via events that are issued by the `merchant` service.\n* **Merchant:** sets prices, redeems e-cash notes from `payment events` that customers issued and it issues events that the valve responds to. Merchants can be light weight and fit on the router if they outsource the e-cash redemption logic to third party APIs. However, thanks to nostr, the merchants don't strictly need to run on the router.\n* **Relay:** simplifies connectivity for services. Nostr relays usually have a public IP address, though TollGates will also have a local relay so critical services that are in the local network continue to function when the TollGate loses internet access.\n\n### What runs where?\nNow that merchants are controlling `valves` via nostr events, it is perfectly fine for the merchant to be a more complex software bundle with an e-cash wallet and lightning support on an `x86 machine`. The merchant can just issue `nostr events` that control the valve irrespective of how the network connecting the `x86 machine` with the `router` looks. Having the ability to shuffle services around between devices like this enables TollGate contributors to create value with the skill sets that they already have.\n#### Order in which devices are being targeted\nThe following table provides an overview of the order in which we hope to target various devices for each of TollGate's services:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Module</th>\n    <th>Low hanging fruits</th>\n    <th>Mid term targets</th>\n    <th>Long term targets</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Crows Nest</td>\n    <td>Router, Mobile</td>\n    <td>x86, armhf</td>\n    <td>IoT</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Valve</td>\n    <td>Router</td>\n    <td>x86, armhf</td>\n    <td>mobile</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Full Merchant</td>\n    <td>x86, armhf</td>\n    <td>router</td>\n    <td>mobile</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Legacy Merchant</td>\n    <td>router</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n##### Crows Nest\nRouters need the ability to buy from other routers so that the network can grow outwards from the gateway. Hence, routers need a crows nest for TollGate based networks to scale. Previously, users interacted with the WiFi captive portals manually and they still can if they like, but it isn't recommended (see section [crows nest vs captive portal](#benefits-of-using-crows-nest-over-captive-portal)). \n\nUsers who own a TollGate can have the WiFi UX that they are already used to because they can connect to their own device using a WiFi password like they already do with their home router. They are not making any compromises since they are authenticating their devices on their own TollGate. The crows nest of their TollGate now purchases internet on their behalf  without their client devices needing to know anything about TollGate.\n\nRequiring that users own a router to get the full TollGate experience could hinder adoption. Sure, they can paste e-cash into the captive portal manually or with a script, but the UX depends on their client device and they have all the down sides of not making granular payments.  Hence, users who want good UX without owning a TollGate would benefit from having the ability to install a [crows nest on their client devices](https://github.com/delcin-raj/tollgate-ui) (`mobile` and `x86`) for more granular and reliable data purchases.\n##### Valve\nEach TollGate needs to have a valve in order to manage access to the internet gateway. The valve runs on the router since that's currently our gate-keeping device. However, ndsctl seems to already have [debian support](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/opennds-daemon-common/ndsctl.1.en.html) so turning an `x86` or `armhf` machine into a TollGate might just be a question of getting the network interfaces and configurations under control on debian. \n\n> Currently there isn't a clear line between ndsctl (which we rely on for gate-keeping) and the captive portal which brings a lot of complexity to TollGate. Hopefully the valve becomes more of a stand alone solution rather than a wrapper around part of a captive portal in future (see section [captive portal](#benefits-of-using-crows-nest-over-captive-portal)).\n\n##### Merchants\n##### Legacy Merchant\nThe \"legacy merchant\" is what we have been using so far. Its just a shell script that runs on the router and [submits incoming e-cash](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-outdated-build-environment/blob/ebb875697ff7bb078382ece6107060f91e240809/files/cgi-bin/curl_request.sh#L287-L291) notes to a 3rd party API that redeems the notes over lightning and returns a HTTP response informing the TollGate whether the payment was redeemed successfully. This worked since day 1 of TollGate thanks to the robust and accessible cashu ecosystem and the fact that no cryptographic libraries or wallets need to run on the router. However, it meant that TollGate's feature set depended on the APIs of cashu developers who are also busy.\n##### Full Merchant\nNow that TollGate has full nostr support, operators can easily run their own e-cash wallet, lightning node and gateway selection business logic on an `x86 machine` and continue to interact with other components of TollGate as if this complex software bundle was running on the router. Clearly this model is more self sovereign and a faster route to building robust TollGates. We can still consider moving (part of) the merchant onto the router for more powerful routers or for `x86/armhf` based TollGates.\n\n#### Benefits of using crows nest over captive portal\n* **Lightning-Fast Connections:** crows nest eliminates the painful waiting and clicking associated with captive portals, enabling near-instant internet access. As a nostr client, it handles payments and authentication in the background without any user interaction.\n* **True Privacy & Flexibility:** the crows nest architecture enables:\n\t* Seamless switching between TollGates without wasting large amounts of prepaid data\n\t* Identity (npub + MAC address) rotation between sessions making ISP data retention more challenging\n\t* Protection against potential abuse since payments are small and frequent, with automatic verification of service delivery\n* **Reliable & Consistent Experience:** captive portals are notoriously inconsistent across different devices, operating systems, and browsers. The crows nest provides a dependable experience by moving critical functionality to the client side, where we have full control over the implementation.\n* **Universal Compatibility:** each crows nest comes with its own npub and produces nostr events, making it straightforward to add support for new devices. There's no need to deal with the complexities of scraping captive portals - devices can even pre-purchase data before switching networks.\n* **Superior Performance:** our testing shows significantly faster session initialisation compared to traditional captive portal solutions, as we bypass the multi-second processing delays typically associated with router-based portals.\n\nWhile a captive portal remains valuable as an on-boarding tool for first-time users, the crows nest enables seamless WiFi access. We believe this approach will eventually make the traditional captive portal experience obsolete for regular users. More detailed information about the issues we faced with captive portals and the solutions we already considered can be found [here](https://opentollgate.github.io/tollgate/early-development-and-mistakes-to-be-avoided).\n\nHuge thanks to nostr:nprofile1qqsthdwa5rs42euhnuz5xsrmmssr84hshwes7uj392vpeldj7z0zw3cppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp0qy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7qg3waehxw309ahx7um5wgh8w6twv5hsef7u3d for making nostr so accessible for TollGate!\n\n",

Not for the money it would become, nor for the purpose and meaning that it would deliver to me, but because it was a decision that was truly mine. \n\nThe whole world and everyone in it has ideas of who you are suppose to be, and most of the time we conform with that in some way or another.  While I did not know it at the time, I knew in my heart of hearts that Bitcoin not only had a chance to save me from a life of mind-numbing pointless work, and nihilistic existence; but more than that, it allowed for me to believe in what I saw for myself, and my own understand of it before what everyone else was telling me. It let me stand up for myself against a world that just wanted to use me and keep me in the suppressed, small role it had relegated to me. Bitcoin allowed for me to decide something else against this system that could not see the light and love that I really am. \n\nThis decision came from my own strong conviction within myself that I knew from the deepest levels within me. Even though it seemed crazy, irrational, and like it wouldn‚Äôt work to everyone else; just like most major decisions that can change your life for the better, I knew it was what I had to do for myself. There are no other people who can make these kind of decisions for you, and that is why they are them in their lives and you are you in your life. Only you can make the decision for yourself about how your life is going to be, where you are going to put your energy and how you are going to save yourself against a world that wants to exploit you like a machine, and give you worthless paper in exchange for it. You can choose something else now, but that decision is on you alone. \n\nWhile I cannot promise that you‚Äôll get rich from Bitcoin, or even that it will be a profitable decision with your timing of the markets, you will learn to have a new kind of conviction and faith in yourself which is a kind of wealth in its own right. You will learn that you can decide to take a risk on your own thoughts and decisions, and that is worth something in and of itself. \n\nJust some food for thought going into 2025.",

    "content": "A remarkable anecdote about Uber's early growth strategy: \n\n \"Regulators eventually figured out they needed to impersonate honest customers, summon a driver through Uber‚Äôs App and then finally arrest them. However, Uber frequently anticipated this scheme and thwarted it. Uber used sophisticated software to identify the cartel‚Äôs enforcers and evade them. Uber altered the apps on the phones of the cartel‚Äôs would-be enforcers‚Äô so that drivers appeared to be unavailable, with their true locations hidden. Actual cars were replaced with non-existent ghost cars in these apps! Thus, the Uber ‚Äúunderground‚Äù rebels could conduct operations right under the regulators‚Äô noses yet still slip away. Sometimes the undercover taxi police would create false identities on a new cell phone number. Even then, Uber quickly adapted. They would deduce (or perhaps be informed, since satisfied Uber customers were turning up everywhere in the growing Uber underground) where the batch of phones had been purchased and eventually identify them. When cartel enforcers did manage to catch a driver. Uber would pay all fines and legal costs.\"\n\nObviously i have no way of verifying how true it is, but, wow.\n\nhttps://www.adamsmith.org/blog/uber-literally-saves-lives",

    "content": "Bull Bitcoin becomes the first mobile Bitcoin wallet that allows users to send and receive asynchronous Payjoin transactions without needing to run their own server, using BIP77!\n\nI am very excited about this new and bleeding-edge feature, because it has been a long-standing ambition of Bull Bitcoin to become the first Bitcoin exchange to process Bitcoin withdrawals via Payjoin (Pay-to-Endpoint) transactions.\n\nHowever, it was hard to justify Bull Bitcoin investing time into building this feature since there were no commercially available end-user Bitcoin wallets that were able to receive Payjoin payments. \n\nIndeed, in order to receive Payjoin payments (BIP78), a Bitcoin wallet needed to be connected to a full node server and be online at the moment the payment is made. This means in practice that only merchants, professional service providers and advanced full node users had the capacity to receive Payjoin payments. This is, we believe, one of the major reasons why Payjoin had failed to gain significant traction among Bitcoin users.\n\nFor this reason, the Payjoin V2 protocol (BIP77) was conceived and developed by Dan Gould, as part of the Payjoin Dev Kit project, to outsource the receiver's requirement to run his own server to an untrusted third-party server called the Payjoin Directory. In order to prevent the server from spying on users, the information is encrypted and relayed to the Payjoin Directory via an Oblivious HTTP server.\n\nBull Bitcoin‚Äôs Payjoin ambitions had been put on hold since 2020, until there was more adoption of Payjoin receiving capabilities among end-user Bitcoin wallets‚Ä¶ \n\nBut it turns out that in the meanwhile, Bull Bitcoin developed its own mobile Bitcoin wallet. And it also turns out that the open-source Bitcoin development firm Let There Be Lightning, which we had collaborated with in the past, had itself collaborated with Dan to build a software library for Payjoin that was compatible with and relatively straightforward to integrate into our own wallet software. All that was missing was to put the pieces together into a finished product. \n\nThanks to the collaborative open source effort of the Payjoin Dev Kit team, Let There Be Lightning team and the Bull Bitcoin team, the Bull Bitcoin wallet has now become the first commercially available end-user mobile wallet on the Google Play store to implement the BIP 77 Payjoin V2 protocol.\n\nMoreover, the Bull Bitcoin wallet has also implemented asynchronous Payjoin payments, which means that a Payjoin transaction can be ‚Äúpaused‚Äù until the receiver or the sender come back online. This way, the receiver's mobile phone can be ‚Äúturned off‚Äù when the sender makes the payment. As soon as the recipient‚Äôs phone is turned back on, the Payjoin session will resume and the recipient will receive the payment. This is a major breakthrough in the mobile Payjoin user experience.\n\nWe would like to thank the Human Rights Foundation for allocating a generous bounty for the development of a Serverless Payjoin protocol and its implementation in a mobile Bitcoin wallet, as well as OpenSats and Spiral for supporting the work of Payjoin Dev Kit, which made this all possible. \n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPayjoin, also known as Pay-to-endpoint, is a protocol which allows the Bitcoin wallet of a payments receiver and the Bitcoin wallet a payments sender to communicate with each other for the purpose of collaborating on creating a Bitcoin transaction. \n\nI first heard about Payjoin (then called Pay-to-endpoint) in 2018 and it completely blew my mind. What I liked most about it was that it was not a protocol change to Bitcoin, but rather it was an application-layer protocol that allows wallets to communicate in order to create smarter and more efficient Bitcoin transactions.\n\nWhereas in a normal Bitcoin payment the transaction is created by the sender, and all the inputs of that transaction belong to the sender, in a Payjoin payment both the sender and the receiver contribute coins as inputs.\n\nIn the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi wrote:\n\n\"some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner\"\n\nWith Payjoin, this assumption is no longer true. With Payjoin, we have fixed one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most fundamental privacy problems... without changing the Bitcoin protocol!\n\nIn a Payjoin transaction, the output amounts visible on the blockchain does not necessarily reflect the value of the payment that was actually exchanged. In other words, you can‚Äôt easily tell how much money one wallet sent to the other. This is great for users that are concerned a malicious third party may be attempting to obtain sensitive information about their finances without their consent. This does not however pose an accounting problem for the Bitcoin wallets involved in that transaction: since both wallets are aware of which coins they used as inputs and outputs, they are independently able to calculate the \"actual\" value of the payment that was sent even if the payment on the blockchain appears to be a of a different amount.\n\nPayjoin breaks the common input ownership heuristic, an assumption used by hackers and fraudsters to track ownership of addresses on the blockchain. The neat thing about this property of Payjoin is that it benefits everyone on the network, not just the Payjoin users themselves.\n\nIt allows the receiver of a payment to opportunistically consolidate his utxos when he is receiving funds, in a way which does not necessarily appear to be a consolidation transaction on the blockchain. Depending on the configuration of a payment transaction, it can also make a regular payment look like a consolidation.  \n\nIn addition to these benefits, the introduction of collaborative peer-to-peer transaction protocols opens up exciting opportunities for the creation of Lightning Network channels, as well as efficiencies for transaction batching. \n\nHow to use Payjoin in the Bull Bitcoin wallet:\n\nIt‚Äôs so seamless, you may not even realize you are using it!\n\nTo receive via Payjoin, simply navigate to the ‚ÄúReceive tab‚Äù using the network ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù and you will see a Payjoin invoice. When you want to get paid, send this invoice to the payer, or show them the QR code. If the sender‚Äôs wallet is compatible with Payjoin, it will be up to the sender to decide whether or not they want to use Payjoin. \n\nTo send via Payjoin, simply paste the receiver's Payjoin invoice, or scan the associated QR code, in the Bull Bitcoin wallet. If you decide that you don‚Äôt want to pay with Payjoin, simply turn off the Payjoin toggle. \n\nOriginal post: https://www.bullbitcoin.com/blog/bull-bitcoin-wallet-payjoin\n\nDownload the wallet: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bullbitcoin.mobile&hl=en-IN\n\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/NJWD.png\n",

    "content": "GM Nostr! üåû\n\nüéÅ Announcing Keycast üîë \nA remote signing platform for teams. \n\nhttps://share.cleanshot.com/y4XbqKpT\n\nRemote signing (NIP-46) has always had a lot of promise. Apps like Amber, nsec.app, and others have made it possible to manage your nostr keys in a way that is safer than browser extensions or pasting your nsec around the internet.\n\nBUT, none of them catered to teams. Groups like  nostr:npub1nstrcu63lzpjkz94djajuz2evrgu2psd66cwgc0gz0c0qazezx0q9urg5l and  nostr:npub19mduaf5569jx9xz555jcx3v06mvktvtpu0zgk47n4lcpjsz43zzqhj6vzk and many many companies out there are just sharing the main account nsec between different people and using it in different apps. A recipe for disaster. \n\nKeycast aims to finally fix this. It allows you to:\n\n- Manage teams of nostr users\n- Manage multiple keys that you want to give others access to\n- Create authorizations for those keys that grant specific permissions that can be changed, revoked, etc. \n- Create your own custom permissions\n- Run the signing infrastructure without any extra work\n\nAnd do it all in a self-sovereign way. Keycast is meant to be run on your server, by you. I think it's tremendously important that this sort of tool doesn't exist as a hosted service (which would basically be a huge key honeypot over time). \n\n The app is both a management web app AND a backend process that manages sub-processes that listen for remote signing requests, check permissions, and sign events.\n\nThere is a basic docker setup to start, but my goal is to have this easily deployable to StartOS, Umbrel, Podman, and others. \n\nCode here: https://github.com/erskingardner/keycast",

The large LCD and touchscreen eliminate the need for an external controller.\n\nThe control board and LCD are designed to be replaced, so you can safely share a SeedHammer II. A replacement kit is $89, comparable to the cost of a manual engraving kit.\n\nThe SeedHammer II OG limited edition is for you with the means to support the project.

Bitcoin Core contributors have been working on this problem for years, and 2024 saw the public release of several new features that significantly improve the situation...\nhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2024/12/20/#p2prelay\n\nSeveral developers devoted much of their time in 2024 towards advancing proposals for covenants, scripting upgrades, and other changes that would support advanced contract protocols such as joinpools and channel factories...\nhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2024/12/20/#covs\n\nOptech covered major releases of popular infrastructure projects throughout the year...\nhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2024/12/20/#releases\n\nIn Optech‚Äôs seventh year, we published:\n\n- 51 newsletters\n- 35 new topic pages\n- over 120,000 words, a 350pg book equivalent\n- a wallet guide for developers\n- over 59hr of podcasts, with 488,000 words of transcripts w/75 guests\n- 200+ non-English translations\nhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2024/12/20/#optech\n\nBitcoin Optech will host an audio recap discussion of this special newsletter with special guests Dave Harding, Niklas G√∂gge, Gloria Zhao, and Brandon Black on Riverside.fm Monday at 15:30 UTC.

This turns out to be not trivial at all, Liquid uses 11-of-15 trusted multisig signers, and even bitVM isn't perfectly trustless, but it's the latest massive improvement to the concept.\n\n",

    "content": "Years ago I remember Maxwell being very sniffy about the threshold ECDSA ideas that involved Paillier. There was a swathe of implementations in the last I guess, 6 years or so but, somehow I started reading some papers that were released since 2021 (links below) and realized .. it's kind of a shit show out there. The main protocols are the old Lindell one and GG18/GG20 ; they're using zk proofs and paillier to basically share keys for an ECDSA calculation. It is complex, and it doesn't \"flow\" as nicely as using one prime order group. An example: in one of the ZK proofs in GG18, you need to calculate a value t_1 = e * beta + gamma, where e is a typical fiat shamir hash, beta is the secret and gamma is a blinding factor. this looks very familiar right? (s = k + ex), but there's a vital detail: t_1 is *just an integer*, not an element of a finite field. Hence, even though e and beta might be values in a field of order N, let's say, then if you choose gamma to also be in that same 0..N-1 set, you've suddenly leaked the secret!\n\nWhy? Because e*beta is in the range 0..N^2, not 0..N. The way to exploit that is to just divide by e: t1/e = beta + gamma/e. And since gamma/e is less than 1 with probability 0.5, the right hand side is basically just beta!\n\nThis is one example, but others included improperly formed paillier public keys and absence of range proof checks, seen in implementations in the wild. Both Binance and Bitgo had the dubious privilege of being mentioned as having implementations that could leak the entire set of private keys in *one* signature - even covertly (i.e. the signing goes through). Not saying everything hasn't been fixed from these reports, but, sheesh.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1234\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114\n\n#cryptography\n\n",

    "content": "# The Labor Theory of Value makes people idiotic\n\nSince forever, I've been fascinated by some seemingly inexplicable phenomena I encounter daily in Argentina‚Äîsomething that makes people prefer slow services over fast ones or trivial services over those that require expertise, study, or specialized knowledge.\n\nToday, I finally understood why, and I‚Äôd like to share it here. The Argentine is a socialist man. We may not be fully conscious of this, but it‚Äôs true. Just as someone who believes there is only one God and that Muhammad is His prophet is a Muslim, regardless of what they claim, we embrace socialist mantras, making us socialists‚Äîeven if we vehemently deny it.\n\nOne of the deepest beliefs ingrained in the Argentine belief system is that the value of something is determined by the amount of work required to produce it. This belief is so deeply rooted in our culture that it‚Äôs taken as common sense. It explains some self-defeating behavior and absurd decision-making.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example: Juan is a graphic designer with a week to complete an important project when his laptop suddenly stops working. In desperation, he takes it to Pedro, a computer repair technician with a solid reputation. Juan is stressed because this is his only laptop, he has no backup, and the deadline is looming. He anxiously asks Pedro how long it will take to fix the problem.\n\nPedro is an expert with extensive experience fixing laptops, especially that specific model. He immediately knows what the issue is and could resolve it in a matter of minutes. However, he tells Juan, ‚ÄúIt will take about a week.‚Äù\n\nBut why!? Why lie? Wouldn‚Äôt Pedro be seen as more efficient, knowledgeable, and even life-saving if he fixed Juan‚Äôs laptop on the spot? The answer: of course not! Remember that Juan doesn‚Äôt value Pedro‚Äôs service based on how quickly his need is met. Not at all. Juan‚Äôs need is irrelevant to Juan. What Juan values is the perceived amount of work Pedro has to do. If Pedro repairs the laptop in half an hour, the service would be perceived as worthless, and Pedro couldn't request more than a few pesos for it.\n\nPedro also believes in the labor theory of value. He feels he should be compensated not just for the time it takes to fix the laptop but for all the years of training and expertise that made the repair possible. Yet, Pedro knows that if he fixes the laptop on the spot, he couldn't charge what he thinks is fair because Juan would feel cheated and never return‚Äîor recommend him to others.\n\nThe result is a compromise where neither party is truly satisfied. Juan waits days for his laptop, and Pedro receives better payment than he would for a quick repair, but still less than he feels his expertise warrants.\n\n\nThe Argentine man is perfectly okay paying one hundred American dollars for a meal or forty dollars for a bottle of mediocre red wine. But paying forty or fifty dollars for a visit to the doctor? No way.\n\nYou could argue that a visit to the doctor might save your life in some cases, but those visits rarely last more than fifteen minutes. How could you justify paying more than what you pay for a bottle of wine that required tens of hours of hard work to produce?\n\n-----\n\nI wite about Argentine people but other Latin American peoples are even more retarded than us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Nostr!\n\nWe are Plan ‚Çø Network, and we‚Äôre absolutely thrilled to finally step into the purple space! Plan ‚Çø Network was born when two of the most passionate Bitcoiners on Earth decided to join forces to do what they love most: educating people about #Bitcoin. Basically they can‚Äôt get enough of babbling on and on about how Bitcoin is the greatest money ever invented, sprinkled with plenty of conspiracy theories for good measure. \n\nNaturally, the best way to ensure their message reached everyone was to create an open-source, centralized library of top-tier educational content and host a ton of classes along the way.\n\nAnd who are these two passionate Bitcoiners I keep talking about? None other than the legendary and inimitable  nostr:npub1r0gzy7ptcecpmjj3uv4kxychpqex3j52e8z9vyg3qy7jvcvyu2uq5tczhq and  nostr:npub1au23c73cpaq2whtazjf6cdrmvam6nkd4lg928nwmgl78374kn29sq9t53j. \n\nThe legend says they sat down at a lovely caf√© in Lugano, and together, they gave birth to this crazy institution we now call Plan ‚Çø Network. We‚Äôre not sure who was holding whose hand during the process, but one thing is for certain: with Rogzy‚Äôs creative genius and Giacomo‚Äôs irresistible Italian charm, the outcome was destined to be world-changing.\n\nThat‚Äôs us in a nutshell, a team of collaborators who are madly in love with Bitcoin and incredibly humbled to be part of this great orange-pilling mission. \n\nSo, what‚Äôs the coolest part about Plan ‚Çø Network?\n\nIt‚Äôs the simplicity: anyone can join. We welcome collaborators of all kinds. Educators, contributors, developers, translators, researchers, designers, organizers, maintainers, and, my personal favorite, dreamers. (Though I might be a bit biased because, well, I love being a dreamer.) \n\nCheck out our GitHub (https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content) to learn more about all the crazy ways collaborators make the magic of Plan ‚Çø come together, who knows maybe you want to join us too? \n\nAnd for this writer, who am I? Deep questions here‚Ä¶ \n\nOfficially, I go by the title Head of Chaos, but many of you know me as  nostr:npub1y67n93njx27lzmg9ua37ce7csvq4awvl6ynfqffzfssvdn7mq9vqlhq62h üíú from the  nostr:npub19mduaf5569jx9xz555jcx3v06mvktvtpu0zgk47n4lcpjsz43zzqhj6vzk and as one of the organizers of the  nostr:npub1nstrcu63lzpjkz94djajuz2evrgu2psd66cwgc0gz0c0qazezx0q9urg5l conferences. Today, I‚Äôm thrilled to be writing to the best purple audience about what‚Äôs been keeping my days busy: my first FOSS passion, Bitcoin communities or how we now like to call them ‚Äúnodes‚Äù.\n\nMeet ‚Äúsome‚Äù of the Team\n\nThe Plan ‚Çø Network team is vast, diverse, full of incredible people and spread almost around every corner of the world. For instance, there‚Äôs  nostr:npub1t0g7qwh5hhypwvfa94hcv6f2eqmtme844r8y5gj8fem687eg9svs3ycd3n, our unstoppable Head of International Expansion, who spends his days traveling around the globe, setting up nodes to ensure Bitcoin education can continue long after we‚Äôre all gone. Then there‚Äôs  nostr:npub1ezaezjyuhnjqkj3unzhc6tqzdu5u7zgd0k4au6yrjvcftjx6gz8s9c8utn, our Chief Operations Officer also known as ‚ÄúThe Survivor of the Chaos‚Äù, the most patient person on our team, who helps bring order to the never ending amount of entropy Rogzy, Giacomo, and I tend to create.\n\nThese are just two examples of the amazing people who make up our ever-growing team. A team that is now beyond excited to be here, learning from all you nostriches. Together, we‚Äôre exploring ways to advance freedom and help others understand the magic that happens among all the relays, notes, and other stuff that keeps this space uncensored and alive.\n\nWe‚Äôd love to hear from you! Who should we interview? What should we do to ensure we‚Äôre learning and sharing the Nostr journey and its growth? Drop your recommendations, insights, or even a friendly ‚Äúhello.‚Äù Your input will help us continue our mission of sharing the process that makes this community free.\n\nThank you for welcoming us into the purple space.

    "content": "Vorwort zur ersten deutschen √úbersetzung des Souver√§nen Individuums:\n\nDas Buch erh√§ltlich auf: https://souver√§neindividuum.de\n\nIn der gro√üen Bilanz der menschlichen Literatur gibt es nur wenige B√ºcher, die die Zukunft akkurat voraussagen und uns den Weg mit ihrem hellen Licht der Weitsicht zeigen. \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" von James Dale Davidson und William Rees-Mogg ist ein solches Meisterwerk, ein vision√§res Buch, das nicht nur das Eintreten des digitalen Zeitalters vorausgesagt hat, sondern auch den intellektuellen Grundstein f√ºr die vollkommene Befreiung des Individuums von dem veralternden Nationstaates gelegt hat. Da wir nun ein paar Jahre nach dem Anfang der vorhergesagten neuen √Ñra stehen, ist es lohnenswert, dieses wegweisende Werk erneut zu betrachten und die vielf√§ltigen Weisen zu untersuchen, in denen seine Ideen verwirklicht wurden, insbesondere durch die ver√§ndernde Kraft von Cypherpunk Technologien. \n\nEin Gang durch die Seiten von \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ist eine Reise durch eine Landschaft der Ideen, die genauso gro√üartig ist wie vielf√§ltig. Die Autoren, beide bekannt f√ºr ihr Wissen in den Gebieten der Finanzen und √ñkonomie, spinnen eine √ºberzeugende Erz√§hlung, die historische Analyse, √∂konomische Theorie und technologisches Vorhersagen miteinander verbindet. Ihre kombinierten Fachkenntnisse erm√∂glichen es ihnen, das Bild einer Welt zu zeichnen, in der das Individuum sich erm√§chtigt. Ausgestattet mit den Werkzeugen der digitalen Technologie, k√∂nnen die Grenzen der Geographie, Kultur und Politik √ºberschritten werden, um ein beispielloses Freiheits- und Wohlstandsniveau zu erreichen. \n\nIm Zentrum von \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" steht die Idee, dass das Eintreten der digitalen Technologie die Machtbalance zwischen dem Einzelnen und dem Staat grundlegend ver√§ndert. Die Autoren argumentieren, dass das Informationszeitalter eine neue Klasse von Individuen geschaffen hat, die nicht den traditionellen Autorit√§tsquellen wie Regierungen und Gro√ükorporationen verpflichtet sind. Diese \"souver√§nen Individuen\" sind in der Lage, die Macht der digitalen Technologie zu nutzen, um Wohlstand zu schaffen, ihren Datenschutz zu gew√§hrleisten und die erstickende Bevormundung des Nationstaates zu entfliehen. \n\n\"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" prophezeite das Erscheinen von Digital-Nomaden: Einzelpersonen, die online arbeiten, w√§hrend sie um die Welt reisen und sich daf√ºr entscheiden, an jenen Orten zu wohnen, die ihnen die beste Umfeld bieten. In dieser globalisierten Welt k√∂nnen Staatsb√ºrgerschaft, Steuerresidenz, Firma-Jurisdiktion, Bankkonten und Investmentdepots aus verschiedenen L√§ndern bezogen werden, wodurch Einzelpersonen ihre Umst√§nde optimieren k√∂nnen, indem sie die besten verf√ºgbaren Optionen in jeder Gerichtsbarkeit ausw√§hlen. \n\nDie Implikationen dieser Vision sind tiefgreifend, da sie die Grundlagen unseres Verst√§ndnisses von Gesellschaft, Politik und √ñkonomie herausfordern. Indem sich \"das souver√§ne Individuum\" als ultimatives Machtzentrum positioniert, bricht der Einzelne mit traditionellen Hierarchien der Autorit√§t und begr√º√üt eine neue √Ñra des Individualismus und der Selbstbestimmung. Dies erfordert wiederum t iefgreifende Auswirkungen auf die Natur der Regierungsf√ºhrung, die Rolle des Staates und die Zukunft der Demokratie selbst. \n\nEines der auff√§lligsten Merkmale von \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ist seine weitsichtige Antizipation der ver√§ndernden Kraft der Cypherpunk-Technologie. Die Autoren geh√∂rten zu den ersten, die das Potenzial der digitalen Technologie erkannten, um eine neue Paradigma der individuellen Befreiung zu schaffen. Ihre Einsichten sind durch den bemerkenswerten Fortschritt der Cypherpunk-Bewegung in den vergangenen Jahren best√§tigt worden. Fast drei√üig Jahre nach der ersten Ausgabe, haben wir jetzt die M√∂glichkeit zu √ºberpr√ºfen, ob unsere heutigen Technologien auch den Prognosen entsprechen. \n\nDer Aufstieg von Bitcoin, der weltweit ersten dezentralen digitalen W√§hrung, ist vielleicht das eindrucksvollste Beispiel f√ºr die Verwirklichung der Vision der Autoren. Indem es die Macht der Kryptographie und des verteilten Konsensus nutzt, hat Bitcoin eine neue Form des Geldes geschaffen, die nicht den Launen der Zentralbanken oder den Unregelm√§√üigkeiten des globalen Finanzsystems unterliegt. Mit einer Bitcoin full node kann der Nutzer f√ºr sich selbst die Regeln seines eigenen Geldsystems definieren, verifizieren, und durchzusetzen, ganz ohne Vertrauen auf Institutionen oder Erlaubnis der Nationalstaaten. Dies hat seinerseits eine neue Klasse von Digital-Unternehmern hervorgebracht, die grenz√ºbergreifend transaktionsf√§hig sind, ohne auf das traditionellen FinanzsystemeI angewiesen zu sein. \n\nCoinjoin ist eine weitere Innovation, die die Privatsph√§re von Bitcoin-Transaktionen verbessert, w√§hrend das Lightning Network schnelle und kosteng√ºnstige Zahlungen bietet. Dank Bitcoin und Protokollen wie Cashu und Fedimint erlebt Ecash eine Renaissance. Cashu erm√∂glicht jedem ein digitales Geldlager zu betreiben, und beseitigt somit das Monopol von Depositbanken. Fedimint verbessert dieses Konzept, indem es Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten unter mehreren Betreibern in verschiedenen Jurisdiktionen verteilt. Diese Technologien zeigen, dass zus√§tzliche Protokolle die Souver√§nit√§t des Benutzers √ºber seine finanziellen Transaktionen im Bitcoin-Ekosystem exponentiell erh√∂hen k√∂nnen. \n\nDie Zero-Knowledge-Kryptographie ist ein weiterer Baustein f√ºr eine freiere Zukunft. Diese Technik erm√∂glicht es Einzelpersonen, Aussagen zu beweisen, ohne die konkreten Informationen preiszugeben. Damit k√∂nnen digitale Dienstleistungen zur Verf√ºgung gestellt werden, ohne dass der pers√∂nlichen Daten der Nutzer ver√∂ffentlicht werden. \nPeer-to-Peer-Systeme wie BitTorrent erm√∂glichen Benutzern direkten Austausch von Dateien und Ressourcen ohne Zwischenstellen, schaffen ein neues Paradigma der dezentralisierten Zusammenarbeit und Wissensaustausch. Zwiebelrouter wie Tor als auch Mixnets wie Nym erm√∂glichen verschl√ºsselte Kommunikation, bei der niemand wei√ü welcher Computer sich zu welchem anderen verbindet, erm√∂glichen freie Kommunikation ohne Angst vor √úberwachung oder Zensur. \n\nSchlie√ülich repr√§sentiert der Aufstieg von Nostr, einem neuen Protokoll f√ºr den standardisierten Austausch von signierten Daten, das neueste Gebiet des fortw√§hrenden Strebens nach digitaler Souver√§nit√§t. Nostr hat es geschafft, mit Alltagsapplikationen ein Web-of-Trust von kryptographischen Schl√ºsseln aufzubauen, welches ein fundentales Basis f√ºr die souver√§ne Zukunft ist. \n\nZusammenfassend ist \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ein bahnbrechendes Werk, das dem Test der Zeit standhalten konnte und eine Landkarte f√ºr das digitale Zeitalter bietet, die heute genauso relevant ist wie bei ihrer ersten Ver√∂ffentlichung. Ihre Autoren, James Dale Davidson und William Rees-Mogg, waren Vision√§re, die die ver√§ndernde Kraft der digitalen Technologie und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Zukunft des Einzelnen in der Gesellschaft vorhergesagt haben. Sowie wir weiterhin den unerbittlichen Marsch der Cypherpunk-Technologien verfolgen, erinnern wir uns an die dauerhafte Kraft der in diesen Seiten enthaltenen Ideen. In einer Welt, die zunehmend von dem Kampf zwischen individueller Freiheit und staatlicher Kontrolle gepr√§gt ist, bleibt \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ein Ruf zu Taten, ein Zeugnis der unerbittlichen Geisteskraft der menschlichen Erfindungskraft und ein Leuchtturm der Hoffnung f√ºr die Zukunft der Menschheit.",

That means if your client does not support outbox, you're not likely to see our posts anymore.\n - I have disabled blastr on my haven relay (other users are still welcomed to use it of course)\n - I am now only using clients that fetch relays correctly, current daily driver is Gossip\n - heavy focus on improving UX for haven to get more users running it, including one click installation on umbrel/start9 and windows PCs.\n\nAlgorithm Relays\n\n - Many of us here have self selected for a chronological algorithm, but what about the 99% of users who try nostr and then leave? My theory is that platforms like twitter and tiktok are much better at retention because most people actually do prefer algorithms. And so with that, I will be prioritizing building the ultimate algorithm relay (WIP at  https://jouble.surge.sh/)\n - Make it easy for anyone to run any kind of algorithm they want, whether that is a good vibes algo, a rage bait algo, a viral algo, anything they want, and support a robust open market for users to choose from.\n\nContent Bots\n\n - Ensuring you don't have to leave nostr to get the information you want.\n - First iteration is mostly newsbots, but this will expand to many more types of content\n\nA lot more focus on building, a lot less focus on shitposting, and taking a more principled approach to nostr development.\n\nlove you nostr <3",

Until now, there has been no project like it.\n\nHowever, with all the wealth stored on hardware wallets (especially those that can only communicate over USB) it's important to have multiple implementations. Lark represents the first complete reimplementation of all common USB HWW clients in a language other than Python.\n\nEven though HWW manufacturers have used a dizzying array of different communication protocols and standards, Lark seeks to be identical to the HWI API, providing direct interchangeability and a more robust ecosystem.\n\nAll common commands are supported, and there is some additional functionality, such as retrieving a wallet registration from Ledger devices to avoid re-registration on every signing.\n\nLark is available as a command line application, and as a Java library for JVM-based applications. Hardware wallet manufacturers are invited to test their devices before it's integrated into Sparrow Wallet. \n\nSee https://github.com/sparrowwallet/larkapp for docs and binaries.\nhttps://m.primal.net/Mmkq.jpg",

    "content": "FICTION PERSPECTIVE: A Lodging of Wayfaring Men by Paul Rosenberg\n\nThough the book was written several years before the world knew of Satoshi Nakamoto, ‚ÄòWayfaring Men‚Äô has since become a legendary text for libertarians, freedom lovers, and bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nPaul Rosenberg has contributed to dozens of books and hundreds of blogs and articles in the freedom space. However, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Rosenberg has published many other fiction titles. Therein lies both the strength and weakness of the book: it is a powerful message delivered in the form of fiction, rather than rhetoric.\n\n‚ÄòWayfaring Men‚Äô is a tale of two brilliant men and their quest to open free markets via the Internet in the early 2000s. James Farber, economist, and Philipp Donson, deep thinker and philosopher, battle the FBI and NSA to bring freedom to the world via the ‚ÄòNew World‚Äô of the Internet.\n\nThe two men aim to spread a completely private and encrypted online free market contained within a computer game. This will result in a global network of markets able to operate in a system outside of government regulation and forced taxation.\n\nThis story was produced during the era of digi-cash, e-gold and Liberty Reserve, currencies and Internet markets that failed or were shut down. What makes it resonate so much with bitcoiners is that the success of Project Gamma (the free market in the book) rests upon unbreakable encryption and decentralization.\n\nThe most exciting portions of the book document the heroes‚Äô intelligent maneuvers and high-risk plots to throw the FBI off the scent. As the markets spread, the US and world governments employ more and more desperate means to stop the outflow of tax dollars and control of productivity. For example, Farber, Donson, and their teams of engineers have broken no laws, which leads the FBI to seek treason charges (in addition to spying on a host of law-abiding citizens).\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to put this book into a genre. It‚Äôs part thriller, part life story of the main characters, and part Utopian manifesto. The elements of the story include romance, religion, loss, and geopolitical change. Yet most of these are not fully developed or explored, rendering the story itself ‚Äòwayfaring‚Äô.\n\nThe villains of the piece are not entirely clear either. Two young FBI agents begin the hunt for those behind Gamma, dealing with the moral dilemmas of legality in different ways. The array of characters involved in the project seem crafted solely to deliver the project to its conclusion rather than giving the reader the ability to connect with their struggles and flaws. Perhaps the real hero is the concept of free trade.\n\nThe structure of the novel wanders too. The story sprawls across character backstories, years of progress on the project, truncated scenes, and unclear jumps in the time and location. Essays and opinion pieces which did not fit into the story are adjoined in a pair of appendices.\n\nIf you are a fan of flowing descriptions, deep character explorations, and literary craft, this is not the novel for you. Wayfaring Men delivers clear and functional prose to meet its lofty ambition ‚Äî outlining our path to freedom.\n\nBut for all its faults, you keep reading. You root for the protagonists to succeed because you want the same thing as they do. Essentially, packaging this idea as fiction opens up a whole new audience ‚Äî those who neglect reading heavy non-fiction manifestos.\n\nOverall, I would describe this as a poor novel, but a powerful book. I found myself recommending it to a fellow freedom enthusiast straight after reading it. Those who are wired to more functional and utilitarian thinking will appreciate the story of how we wrestled freedom from the jaws of enslavement.\n\nPhilip Charter, Editor.\n\n\np.s. Thanks to nostr:npub1klkk3vrzme455yh9rl2jshq7rc8dpegj3ndf82c3ks2sk40dxt7qulx3vt for the recommendation.\n\ncheck out his recent audiobook recording of Wayfaring Men if you please.\n\n\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Mlie.jpg\n",

Instead of blinding the message that the signer signs, you blind what key is being used to sign the (public) message.  A signature is technically a ZKP (a zk-proof of knowledge). I have x, I give the server b+x, they sign with that: s' = k + e(b+x), I subtract eb to get s = k + ex. Notice that this is a weakness (arguably a fatal weakness) of non key-prefixed schnorr; it only works if you hash H(R,m) not H(P,R,m).",

    "content": "I‚Äôm back with another essay from The Cypherpunk‚Äôs Bible. \n\nA Lodging of Wayfaring Men by Paul Rosenberg. \n\nIf you haven‚Äôt read this book I encourage you to. Recently nostr:npub1klkk3vrzme455yh9rl2jshq7rc8dpegj3ndf82c3ks2sk40dxt7qulx3vt recorded the audio version which you can find here on Paul‚Äôs website. \n\nhttps://freemansperspective.com/audiobook-a-lodging-of-wayfaring-men/\n_____________________________ \n\nFarber‚Äôs Second Essay\n\nHistory books tell the stories of rulers. Some are kings, some emperors, some presidents or prime ministers, and some bear more exotic titles. A few of them were more or less benevolent, and others were tyrants. Most were in between, but they all held one thing in common: they maintained a monopoly on the use of force in their territories. They reserved the right to use coercion and prevented all others from doing so. \n\nStripped of romantic rhetoric and patriotic emotion, the essence of rulership is the ability to maintain a monopoly of force. Argue if you like, but you will be arguing with the dictionary. Every reform of government and rulership to date has kept the central mechanism of coercion in place. Did some governmental reforms lead to improvements? Certainly, they made things considerably less bad. But they left centralized coercion in place, and for every good leader that has come along, such as a Washington or a Churchill, we‚Äôve had several times as many Stalins or Maos.\n\nI have friends who study such things, and they assure me that roughly 2% of all people would be dictators if they had the opportunity. If they could oppress the world, they would. Another 12% or so are would-be facilitators‚Äîthat is, when one of the 2% rises to power, these people are glad to fill a slot and vigorously exercise power over others. Like it or not, these people are out there, and they are drawn to the levers of power. Once in a while, they have their turn. When they do, innocent people die in large numbers. Over 100 million died this way in the past century. Try to comprehend that: 100 √ó 1,000 √ó 1,000 people. Boys, girls, men, women, teenagers‚Äîshort, tall, strong, weak, dark-skinned, and light-skinned‚Äîall of them dead because twisted people were able to take hold of centralized force.\n\nIf you‚Äôve wondered why some of us are so determined to keep governments out of cyberspace, please understand that this is why. We‚Äôve had enough of centralized force. We are removing the whole mechanism. We think it was a mistake from the beginning. We don‚Äôt want there to be anything for the 2% to grab. \n\nIf you want coercive rulership, keep it. We won‚Äôt try to take it away from you, but we have chosen to opt out. Don‚Äôt try to reign us back in. We won‚Äôt try to make you live our way, and you don‚Äôt try to make us live your way. We are not your property. \n\nOur arrangement has no central mechanism of coercion, and it has been working quite well for several years now. We like it. This new arrangement has, however, surprised us in several ways. One of the things we discovered was that once you remove the mechanisms of coercion, you remove something else: politics. Politics is the art and science of managing centralized coercion. This is the reason political debates are so infuriating. The final decision leads to an opposable force. Once the political process is completed, you have the choice either to obey or to be punished. \n\nCoercion is the sine qua non of politics‚Äîthe thing without which politics would not be politics. Indeed, if you remove coercion, politics becomes something else: economics. \n\nThings work here by economic means. If you don‚Äôt like the way a market operates, just move to a different one. Or, if no one does it the way you think is right, start your own. There are no protected services here and nothing mandatory. You may opt out of anything you don‚Äôt like or offer any service you like. We couldn‚Äôt stop you if you wanted to start a communist collective. The only limitation would be that you could not force anyone to join or remain part of your collective. We have no mechanism for that. The entire system is built around the idea that persuading people to trade with you is moral and that forcing them is not.\n\nWe think our ideas are right, but we will not impose them on you. You can hold whatever ideas you like; just don‚Äôt impose them on us. \n\nAll this being said, what really concerns your rulers‚Äîand what is driving them to demonize us‚Äîis that people are leaving their systems and joining ours. Your children are enjoying the private digital economy in huge numbers. \n\nNo, the young people are not joining us for historical and philosophical reasons. Those things are mostly for us older people. Young people, as always, are looking for adventure and opportunity. In your regulated world, very few people ever get much real adventure or overwhelming success. They read about such things in novels and celebrity tabloids; they see them in movies, but very few actually experience such things. Our world, on the other hand, has adventure and opportunity in wholesale quantities. Your children may have to work hard to get it, but a big life is waiting for them if they wish to earn it.\n\nIn our world, intelligence, daring, and perseverance are rewarded far more directly than in your regulated world. Here, you can be a complete unknown with no connections and no wealth. But if you can learn to provide excellent ideas or services, you can get rich. No one here knows or cares about the color of your skin, your sex, who you sleep with, or anything of the sort. If you can produce, you‚Äôre a player. Want to go from rags to riches? Pick a valuable skill in our world, throw yourself into it with all your might, excel at it, and start selling it. Effort is all you need. You don‚Äôt need friends in the right places, only value to offer.\n\nAnd there‚Äôs more. The truth is that the best rewards come to those who are first at something new. Jobs and Wozniak were the first to produce a good personal computer, but other people would‚Äôve done the same thing within a year or two. They got to do all the cool stuff only because they were first. You can say the same thing for every other discovery or invention. Human knowledge is built piece upon piece, and new discoveries follow more or less in that sequence. If you want to do the really fun things, you have to get to the front of the line. \n\nThe stream of human knowledge is now firmly rooted in our world. The frontier of Alvin Toffler‚Äôs third wave is in cyberspace, and that‚Äôs where the front of the line can be found.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the future of the third wave: The central ideal of your old world is coercive authority. This is embodied not only in rulership but in schools, families, religions, and most every area of life. We were all born into a world that told us, ‚ÄúDo what you‚Äôre told, or we‚Äôll hurt you.‚Äù Our parents told us that. Our teachers imposed it on us. Our gods were envisioned this way. And certainly, the rulers of the Earth operate this way. From birth to death, continually, it confronts you all.\n\nHaving lived with these ideas for a 100 generations, humanity is used to this and can survive it moderately well. But it is far from ideal.\n\nFrom birth on, you were trained to obey or else‚Äîto worry that you might do something wrong without realizing it. It puts you in a sort of perpetual cringe, unconsciously cowering in expectation of the next blow. Being used to it is no reason to think it isn‚Äôt damaging. \n\nWe have eliminated this. It has no root here, no mechanism. This is having an effect on the world already, although it certainly has a long way to go. But it is here, and it is not fading away. It may be a generation or two before we begin to see how the coercion-free mind works, longer before it becomes dominant. Nonetheless, the seeds have been planted, and they are thriving.\n\nWe certainly didn‚Äôt start this. Its roots trace back to every free thinker, to every rebel for truth, to the true heroes who, in a thousand areas of life, had the courage to be right even in the face of opposition. We are simply carrying on their work at the moment when it threatens to reach critical mass. If we were simply one more reform movement, we would seek to conquer your system and run it our way. That, however, is not what we are. We do not accept coercion as moral. We do not wish to coerce anyone, and we will not submit to being forced. We do not want to run your system.\n\nIf all of this seems threatening to you, I‚Äôm sorry. I know how that can feel. We are not your enemies. We are your friends. We are also your future. We will not harm you. We do not want to take your government away from you. We do not want to control your government. We are not asking you to change your lives. We are only withdrawing from your game. Go your own way in peace. We wish you well. We still love you. We still care about you. We‚Äôll still spend time with you, and in the right situation, we would still defend you. But we will not remain part of your coercive systems.\n\nWe are pleased to share this planet with you, but we do not wish to share your social structures. We want to do a new thing, a better thing. If you wish the best for your children, encourage them to step into a new world‚Äîa world where they can own their own lives and enjoy the fruits of their own labor. A perfect world?

From the user's perspective, nothing changes compared to a classical top-up and purchase experience. \n\nThat way, you wouldn't need to know which credit card transaction belongs to which VPS purchase.

    "content": "Android 15 QPR2 is moving 6th/7th/8th generation Pixels to the Linux kernel's 6.1 LTS branch already used for 9th generation Pixels. This will reduce the kernel branches we need to support down to 6.1 and 6.6. There will likely need to be a yearly migration for all the devices.\n\nLinux kernel increased official support time for the Long Term Support (LTS) branches from 2 years to 6 years, mainly for Android devices using Generic Kernel Image (GKI) releases. However, it was recently reduced back to 2 years. Pixels will need to start migrating every year.\n\nIt will likely take around 6 months for a new branch to be considered stable enough with most regressions resolved and another 6 months to successfully integrate and ship it. Therefore, 2 years of support implies yearly migrations to keep up rather than doing it every 2 years.\n\nUpstream LTS releases are closely connected to Android. Moving to 6 years of support was likely closely connected to the Pixel 6 moving to 5 years of support. GKI made the drivers far more standalone and easy to migrate, and Linux moving back to 2 year support is likely related.\n\nGoogle has been testing newer kernels with the Pixel 6 and later for years. They have 6.6 and newer mainline kernels working fine already, it just takes a long time until the kernels are stable enough to consider shipping them. It's great that it's finally going to be happening.\n\nNewer kernels bring many new features and increasingly complexity which means they bring lots of new security bugs. Older kernels get an increasingly small subset of bug fixes including security fixes backported in the LTS releases. Newer kernels also bring new security features.\n\nUsing a year old kernel for around a year and then upgrading to a new year old kernel is likely the best balance that's available. With 2 year support time, they can focus on backporting more patches and providing more testing/stability since there will be far fewer LTS branches.\n\nIt's not commonly understood that Android itself only has a single LTS branch, which is current Android 15. It receives monthly and quarterly updates. It moves to a new LTS with a yearly update after it has gone through many months of public testing via Developer Preview / Beta.\n\nMany people including journalists covering it in tech news media wrongly believe Android's monthly security patch releases are the monthly releases. No, the monthly security patches are backports of a subset of the privacy/security patches to older releases. They're incomplete.\n\nAndroid's monthly releases have many changes beyond privacy/security patches even when it's not a quarterly or yearly release. They also have a lot more privacy/security patches than the Android Security Bulletin backports. They backport High/Critical severity patches, not all.\n\nThese updates are a major factor in why Pixels are the only Android devices with competitive security with iPhones. Pixels also have a lot of hardware security features not implemented on other Android devices. They also have higher quality of implementation across the board.\n\nGoogle will likely require other OEMs start upgrading kernel branches. However, standards for other OEMs are always far lower than the standards met by Pixels. For example, many important hardware security features are recommended in the CDD, not mandatory, or not even listed.\n\nWe aren't aware of any OEM trying to keep up with the monthly releases, only OEMs skipping all the monthly/quarterly releases but trying to ship the yearly release around the official launch. Only Samsung tries to keep up with the new security features, but lags quite behind.\n\nOther Android OEMs do the bare minimum required by Google unless their SoC vendor (generally Qualcomm) hands the feature to them on a silver platter with no additional cost. They largely ship the monthly security backports now, but with significant delays or skipping some months.\n\nThe reduction of support time for Linux kernel LTS releases from 6 years to 2 years is likely going to become a major problem for non-Pixel Android devices. Google will likely require them to upgrade but probably at a very delayed schedule where they fall out of support first.\n\nOur official hardware requirements are listed here:\n\nhttps://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices\n\nYou can see support for Linux 6.1 or 6.6 is already a requirement for new devices. We'll be adding a requirement to upgrade the kernel branch because it will be essential with 2 year Linux LTS support.\n\n#GrapheneOS",

    "content": "#longread #TLDR\n\nSummary:\n\nJames Farber's essay discusses the concept of the \"positive-sum game,\" which refers to a system where human energy and creativity are allowed to flourish, leading to the creation of wealth and innovation. He argues that this system is the key to human progress and that it is being stifled by governments and bureaucracies that seek to control and regulate human activity. Farber advocates for human freedom and creativity, and suggests that the only place where this can truly be achieved is in \" #cyberspace .\"\n\nKey Points:\n\nI. The Positive-Sum Game\n\n* Refers to a system where human #energy and creativity are allowed to flourish\n* Leads to the creation of wealth and innovation\n* Is the key to human #progress\n\nII. History of the Positive-Sum Game\n\n* Originated in the merchant class of Venice\n* Flourished in America and other parts of the world\n* Is based on the idea that human energy is the driving force behind #creativity and #innovation\n\nIII. The Zero-Sum Game\n\n* Based on the idea that there is only a fixed amount of #wealth and resources available\n* One person's gain must come at the expense of another\n* Is a false idea used to justify control and regulation\n\nIV. Government Intervention\n\n* Stifles the positive-sum game by imposing regulations and taxes\n* Limits human creativity and innovation\n* Is often justified by the idea of \"helping the poor,\" but ultimately leads to a life of dependency and stagnation\n\nV. Cyberspace as a Solution\n\n* Is the only place where humans can truly be free to pursue their own interests and passions\n* Allows for the creation of a new space for human freedom and creativity\n* Is necessary for the survival and flourishing of the positive-sum game\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\n* Human #freedom and #creativity are essential for human progress\n* Governments and bureaucracies often stifle these values\n* #Cyberspace offers a new opportunity for human freedom and creativity to flourish.",

    "content": "FARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY \n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn‚Äôt know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families. \nIt began to break out when the deep superstition of the middle ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far -off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over a hundred years. \nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the great discovery of the modern era: the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It is the operation of creation, using the only counter entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab, to the front office, to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service, and it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skill overcomes a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud, and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do ‚Äì to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion ‚Äì it cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world; within several decades their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their Kings, seeking permissions from their rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and braking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild; as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the middle ages, and not much else. Do you think the people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not! You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äì human energy ‚Äì creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves are of little worth, and when you add human creativity you can create vehicles, computers, and space ships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of the earth, if they could have turned into something great of themselves they would have done it long ago. But they cannot ‚Äì it is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of materials becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey who do not play the positive-sum game instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚Äì the idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks of ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth,‚Äô but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experiment of communism has taught the world‚Äôs rulers that the positive-sum game is necessary. So, their plan now is to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it all together. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world upon our backs. Are they worth half of our efforts ‚Äì half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees and regulations ‚Äì for what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor,‚Äù they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you that this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so ‚Äì even to consider it.\n\nAnd are the poor better off? Certainly some of our money goes to the poor (although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy). This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp, and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you. \nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat phrases like, ‚Äúthat is the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason, and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them ‚Äì you are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half-speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s. Then, slowly, the curbs and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had been, as one writer said, ‚Äògeared for giants.‚Äô But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive-sum game ‚Äì only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half -speed, yet its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum gave during my lifetime ‚Äì Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the east in one generation ‚Äì an explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and stillborn! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats world-wide. Where will we go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled, or will it migrate to new and open lands?\n\nBut! Moving to a new land will be a problem, won‚Äôt it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So, until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found ‚Äì cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will ‚Äì and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants ‚Äì establish the positive-sum game without restriction. \n\nToward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it, and we‚Äôve broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now, the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment, and see if freedom really is better than ser vitude. Why won‚Äôt they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind, or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want is to be left alone and to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us? \n ~ James Farber ",

    "content": "FARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY \n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn‚Äôt know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families. \nIt began to break out when the deep superstition of the middle ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far -off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over a hundred years. \nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the great discovery of the modern era: the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It is the operation of creation, using the only counter entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab, to the front office, to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service, and it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skill overcomes a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud, and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do ‚Äì to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion ‚Äì it cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world; within several decades their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their Kings, seeking permissions from their rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and braking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild; as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the middle ages, and not much else. Do you think the people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not! You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äì human energy ‚Äì creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves are of little worth, and when you add human creativity you can create vehicles, computers, and space ships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of the earth, if they could have turned into something great of themselves they would have done it long ago. But they cannot ‚Äì it is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of materials becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey who do not play the positive-sum game instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚Äì the idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks of ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth,‚Äô but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experiment of communism has taught the world‚Äôs rulers that the positive-sum game is necessary. So, their plan now is to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it all together. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world upon our backs. Are they worth half of our efforts ‚Äì half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees and regulations ‚Äì for what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor,‚Äù they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you that this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so ‚Äì even to consider it.\n\nAnd are the poor better off? Certainly some of our money goes to the poor (although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy). This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp, and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you. \nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat phrases like, ‚Äúthat is the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason, and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them ‚Äì you are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half-speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s. Then, slowly, the curbs and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had been, as one writer said, ‚Äògeared for giants.‚Äô But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive-sum game ‚Äì only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half -speed, yet its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum gave during my lifetime ‚Äì Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the east in one generation ‚Äì an explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and stillborn! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats world-wide. Where will we go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled, or will it migrate to new and open lands?\n\nBut! Moving to a new land will be a problem, won‚Äôt it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So, until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found ‚Äì cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will ‚Äì and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants ‚Äì establish the positive-sum game without restriction. \n\nToward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it, and we‚Äôve broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now, the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment, and see if freedom really is better than ser vitude. Why won‚Äôt they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind, or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want is to be left alone and to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us? \n ~ James Farber ",

Fountain Radio makes it fun again.\n\nWave goodbye to algorithmic playlists and say hello to a new communal listening experience powered by Bitcoin and Nostr.\n\nFountain Radio is live in version 1.1.8 now. Here's how it works:\n\nAdd and upvote tracks in the queue ‚ûï\n\nSearch for any song on Fountain and pay 100 sats to add it to the queue.. Upvote any track in the queue to change its position. 1 sat equals 1 upvote and the track with the most upvotes will play next.\n\nSupport the artist currently playing ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nBoost to send a payment with a message on enable streaming to send a small amount for every minute you spend listening. 95% of every boost and streaming payment goes directly to the artist currently playing.\n\nPost in the live chat üí¨\n\nHang out with other listeners in the live chat by connecting Nostr. You can post chat messages for free. Every time a track is added or upvoted this appears in the activity feed too.\n\nSave tracks to your library üíú\n\nListen to your latest discoveries again later in the app. Tap on any content card to add a song to your library or a playlist, or see more music from that artist.\n\nListen to Fountain Radio on other apps üéß\n\nFountain Radio now has its own RSS feed so you can tune in on any podcast app that supports live streams and Nostr live streaming platforms like  nostr:npub1eaz6dwsnvwkha5sn5puwwyxjgy26uusundrm684lg3vw4ma5c2jsqarcgz.\n\nArtist takeovers üîí\n\nArtists can now take control of the music and host a listening party. During a takeover, only the host can add tracks to the queue and upvotes are disabled.\n\nThe first artist takeover will be with  nostr:npub19r9qrxmckj2vyk5a5ttyt966s5qu06vmzyczuh97wj8wtyluktxqymeukr on Wednesday 27th November at 12:00pm EST.

    "content": "Over the past few weeks, we have been learning and testing the MLS protocol and have gained a deeper understanding of it. Below is a note providing a general description of the MLS protocol.\n\nThe MLS group members (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) form the leaf nodes of a binary tree as shown below. Each member has a pair of public and private keys.\n\nFor member A, they use their private key Ôøº and member B‚Äôs public key Ôøº to perform an ECDH computation. For member B, they use their private key Ôøº and member A‚Äôs public key Ôøº to perform an ECDH computation. \n\nBoth compute the same value. This value becomes the private key of Node3, and from this, the public key of Node3 can also be derived.\n\nSimilarly, other members perform their respective ECDH computations.\n\nMoreover, nodes higher in the tree also perform their respective ECDH computations up to the Root. Node3 and Node4 compute the private key of Node1 through ECDH, while Node5 and Node6 compute the private key of Node2. Node1 and Node2 compute the private key of the Root through ECDH.\n\nThe private key of the Root is the shared key among the MLS group members. Each member uses this shared key along with their respective related keys to derive their message encryption key.\n\nThe most important feature of this key tree is that child nodes know the private keys of their parent nodes.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nIf member A suspects their key has been compromised, they need to update their key.\n\nMember A generates a new key pair Ôøº (public key and private key) locally and recalculates the keys for Node3‚Äô, Node1‚Äô, and Root‚Äô.\n\nThen, A encrypts the public keys of Node3‚Äô and Node1‚Äô using the old public keys of Node3 and Node1, respectively, and sends them to all group members.\n\nWhen member H receives and decrypts the message, they obtain the public key of Node1‚Äô and, combined with the private key of Node2, perform an ECDH computation to calculate the new private key of Root‚Äô.\n\nOther members perform similar operations. As a result, all members successfully update the key tree.\n\nThe advantage of the MLS protocol is that when a member updates their key, the complexity of updating the key tree is reduced to ÔøºO(logN).\n\nImagine if there were no binary tree. When A updates their key, they would need to update the message one-to-one for each group member, resulting in a complexity of ÔøºO(N).\n\nHowever, if member B‚Äôs key is compromised, member A updating their key cannot rescue member B. Each member‚Äôs update key operation can only protect themselves, not all members. https://image.nostr.build/10752c810a9aef73885173ecb7b76f9e65ce322c2c2edefdda7a82dd4b58d7a4.jpg https://image.nostr.build/80864aad3cb9a3e8ecd91cd0de77c10cd5ba9d54dbe182c9631825ab0482069b.jpg  nostr:note1guzracdd3rfyussrfxjt63h3seela9a0jyzx5hd7gjmzhxsx7efs57mq8y",

    "content": "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death\n ~ Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775\n\nNo man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\n\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\n\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free ‚Äî if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending ‚Äî if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained ‚Äî we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\n\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable ‚Äî and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.\n\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace ‚Äî but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n",

    "content": "On November 19th, 404Media published a news article with the device support chart for Magnet Forensics GrayKey, a forensic device extraction kit used exclusively by governments and a competitor of Cellebrite's UFED and MSAB XRY. The article contains data on the devices supported by GrayKey and the best extraction type available for the device based on monthly Security Patch Level. The results available from the charts are the same as our expectations made from our insights with other forensic company activities and people who inform us of their capabilities. We also are seeing a domino effect of further publications of leaked capabilities from forensic firms after our publication of the April and July 2024 Cellebrite device support matrix.\n\nFrom what you can see in the GrayKey documentation, our previous disclosure of vulnerabilities affecting Stock OS Pixel devices that were exploited by forensics firms such as MSAB in the start of the year have disrupted their capabilities. We reported those exploits to Google in January 2024 with multiple proposals on how to stop it. In April 2024, the first two patches for these vulnerabilities were shipped and we can see that since April 2024 the extraction capability for GrayKey on all Pixel devices they supported were downgraded.\n\nhttps://image.nostr.build/78f47da06d2601e616360cb8745e2bff09f8507766237db79f44cdc4c1ff00b2.jpg\n\nWe have a good idea of what was happening based on the detailed info we obtained about MSAB's XRY exploit tool. XRY was exploiting littlekernel-based fastboot mode firmware used on Pixels via USB. Many other devices also use littlekernel for this, or the higher attack surface EDK2. CVE-2024-29745 is the identifier for the reset attack vulnerability we reported for the fastboot mode. Google addressed this in April 2024 by implementing our proposal of zeroing memory on boot. Graykey was downgraded from Full access to Partial access in April 2024 and has stayed that way since.\n\nCellebrite Premium is clearly exploiting the stock Pixel OS via USB rather than using this approach. Therefore, Cellebrite didn't lose any capabilities on the Stock OS because of the improvement - however they lost brute force capability. Our exploit protections have been successfully blocking Cellebrite even before major improvements in 2024 and GrapheneOS is still unaffected by their tools.\n\nThe device's data is divided in 2 parts: The vast majority of data is Credential Encrypted (CE) per-profile and a small portion of OS data is Device Encrypted (DE). DE data is available to the OS Before First Unlock (BFU). Exploiting fastboot mode will only give DE data since April 2024. One of our planned features is a boot authentication toggle to request the Owner lock method in early boot. This will protect the small amount of DE data such as installed packages and saved Wi-Fi networks from firmware/hardware exploits. However, it's not sensitive user data.\n\nPartial access means limited access to operating system metadata and the Device Encrypted data and we are not concerned over such a limited data scope.\n\nCellebrite's approach of exploiting the OS itself is more difficult but they avoided having nearly all their capabilities wiped out by the reset attack mitigation we successfully got Pixels to implement. Other Android devices haven't implemented reset attack mitigation though. The way Google implemented it only covers fastboot mode. We wanted them to cover the OS boot modes too but they haven't shipped it yet. Our zero-on-free feature addresses it for OS reboot/shutdown and we plan to add zero on boot too until we convince them to add it in firmware.\n\nCellebrite's approach involves attacking the OS itself so all of our generic memory corruption exploit protections and other defenses are there to stop it. We also nearly fully wiped out the USB attack vector for the OS with our 2024 overhaul of our USB attack surface reduction. By default, #GrapheneOS disables new USB-C connections as soon as the device is locked at both a hardware and software level. It then fully disables USB-C data at a hardware level once existing connections end or right away if there weren't any. They'd need another attack vector. \n\nFor example, they could still target GrapheneOS via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular. However, getting into the device from any of those will still be much harder than with the stock OS, and it's more complex than USB in general. There's a reason they have always preferred USB. USB is preferred because it provides little tampering with the OS and maintains forensic soundness. \n\nAt this current point in time Cellebrite is certainly the industry leader when it comes to Pixel research. Their research teams follow the same trends and innovations and want to research attacks for #security technologies we desire or have inherited on our platforms when they have become available, such as MTE and PAC. A GrapheneOS extraction capability of any kind is high-demand for any company in the forensics industry and they appear dedicated to want to be first which makes sense as they are certainly the largest. We will continue providing commensurate response to any new threats.\n\nSince 2021, we've had an auto-reboot timer feature which reboots the device after it's locked if it isn't unlocked before the timer expires. iOS recently added this with a hard-wired 72 hour timer. Our default is 18 hours but users can configure it from 10 minutes to 72 hours. If you need maximum protection, using the 10 minute auto-reboot would be ideal. There's also the option to fully disabling USB-C while OS is booted by also disabling charging including USB-PD. You can also enable turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth via timers, which we plan to extend to NFC. You should also get any of the 4 currently available 9th gen Pixels to use GrapheneOS. They have more cellular radio hardening and GrapheneOS-specific kernel hardening implemented right now, but 8th gen is likely going to upgrade to the same 6.1 kernel branch soon.\n\nWe strongly recommend 8th/9th gen Pixels for greatly improved security on GrapheneOS via hardware memory tagging. It's enabled for the base OS including apps by default and opt-in for user installed apps, whcih we recommend, and then opt-out per app for apps with bugs it catches.",

It rests on three primary principles: Individual Autonomy, Private Property, and Free Contract.\n2. Progress must not be hindered.\n3. Free, open, and functional markets must be preserved.\n4. The CEP deals with individual parties only.\n5. Agreements must be communicated openly and clearly.\n6. Individuals/parties should keep their agreements.\n7. Individuals/parties should not aggress against, encroach upon, or defraud others.\n8. Private property is to be respected and protected.\n9. Self-induced harms are the sole responsibility of the individual or party in question.\n10. All the effects of an action must be taken into account.\n11. Restitution is preferred above punishment.\n12. Violence is a very costly means of solving disputes and is to be avoided.\n12. Mistakes and emergency actions are part of human life, but must be repaired.\n13. The CEP does not require omniscience of anyone.\n14. The purposes of judgments are to secure free and functional markets and to recompense injured parties.\n‚Äã15. The standard for the application of the CEP is the reasonable man.",

    "content": "This essay in Paul Rosenberg‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA Lodging of Wayfaring Men‚Äù has never been more important than it is today. \n\nFARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY\n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn't know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families.\n\n It began to break out when the deep superstition of the Middle Ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far-off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over 100 years.\n\nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the greatest discovery of the modern era, the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It's the operation of creation using the only counter-entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab to the front office to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service. And it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skills overcome a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do, to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion. It cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world. Within several decades, their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their kings, seeking permissions from rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and breaking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild, as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the Middle Ages and not much else. Do you think that people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not. You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äî human energy ‚Äî creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves, are of little worth, and when you add human creativity, you can create vehicles, computers, and spaceships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of Earth. If they could have turned into something great of themselves, they would have done it long ago. But they cannot. It is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of material becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey, who do not play the positive-sum game, instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is, ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚ÄîThe idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks at the ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth‚Äô, but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experience of communism has taught the world's rulers that the positive sum game is necessary, so their plan is now to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it altogether. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world on our backs. Are worth half of our efforts ‚Äî half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees, and regulations. For what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor‚Äù, they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further, that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is it not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so, or to even consider it.\n\nAre the poor better off? Certainly. Some of our money goes to the poor. (Although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy.) This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you.\n\nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat praises like, ‚Äúwell, that's the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them. You are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice of either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and I realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s, then slowly the curves and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had, as a writer once said, been geared for giants. But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive sum game, only to slow it down. Only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half-speed. Yet, its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum game during my lifetime: Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the East in one generation. An explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and still-born! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats worldwide. Where will it go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled? Or will it migrate to new and open lands? But, moving to a new land will be a problem, won't it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found: Cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants, establish the positive-sum game without restriction. Toward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it and we've broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment and see if freedom really is better than servitude. Why won't they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind? Or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want to do is be left alone to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us?",

    "content": "MA: Frances, are you ready?\n\nJF: Yes, I am.\n\nMA: OK, hang on and I‚Äôll post some reasons why these ideas bother\npeople. Take a look through the list, and see which ones seem to fit you.\n\nThe first one probably doesn‚Äôt fit you, but I‚Äôm leaving it in because it does fit a lot of people. Remember also that people don‚Äôt really think about these things, they just react.\n\nMA:\n\n1. Fear of responsibility. Freedom is threatening because it eliminates the possibility of shifting responsibility for your errors onto others. Freedom puts you right out in the open, with no cloak for your mistakes. It also gives you full credit for your successes, but that is seldom considered, as the fear-based impulses are generally stronger.\n\n2. Fear of separation. For a variety of reasons, most people have an\ninstinctual fear of being separate. The feeling is that separation means death. This may be true in some rare situations, and certainly was true more commonly in the distant past, but it is an impulse only, not reason.\n\n3. Rulership as a force of nature. For the last several thousand years,\nnearly all humans have lived and died under some form of rulership. So many generations have come and gone under this arrangement, that it now seems to most people as a force of nature: That which was, is, and shall be. When you mention something different, it causes them  mental stress.\n\n4. No mental image. Because none of us have ever lived in any situation except subjection to state power, we have no mental images of anything different. So, when we start talking about a truly free place with no rulers, the listeners have no images to draw upon. It seems like we are proposing a pointless journey into an unknown and dangerous place. Again, this is a feeling, not reasoned thought.\n\n5. Group conditioning. A central fact of modern social behavior is that almost the entire populace has gone through 11-17 years of social conditioning in the school systems. This conditioning shows up in a variety of ways, especially in dealing with authority figures. The conditioned responses are: Obey authority. Don‚Äôt cause a disruption. Accept the place given to you. Conform. The real effect here is the installing of comfortreactions and discomfort-reactions. Our system flies in the face of almost all of this.\n\n6. Lack of critical thinking skills. For a variety of reasons (which I have not spent the time necessary to properly catalog), the 20th Century saw a mass movement away from respect for reason and toward a devotion to emotion. Have you ever tried to reason with someone who lives by emotion? It is essentially impossible. These people can be influenced by getting them to identify with characters from movies and television, or with celebrities, but seldom by reason. Now, most people aren‚Äôt fully that way, but modern critical thinking skills are disastrous, and a great many people distrust reason, with full faith in emotion. Many of them are beyond hope of recovery, and could be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.\n\n7. Cognitive dissonance. This is what happens to people when they have accepted an idea, or series of complimentary ideas; then, an obviously different idea is presented, and it makes some sort of sense to them. It causes a conflict. This is properly called cognitive dissonance, and it is really just a mental conflict. People don‚Äôt do well with these conflicts; their general reaction is to eliminate them as quickly as possible. The easiest way to do this is to simply drown them out by reciting their original ideas, and trying to convince themselves that the previous ideas are right, and 148 that they should not think about the new idea. Yes, this is dishonest, and yes, it requires denial, but most people prefer it to critical analysis of their existing ideas, and, potentially, changing their minds. Combine this with all the other items shown here, and the conflicts arising from taking on a difficult new idea are too much for many people to bear.\n\n8. Fear of reprisal. This is the simplest one. Think of an IRS audit, an FBI raid, or of Stalin. Obviously the rulers won‚Äôt like our free markets. It is not unreasonable to expect that they will take reprisals against people who displease them. A very reasonable concern.\n\n9. Fear of the world falling apart. The central myth of the nation-state is that it is necessary to hold civilization together; that without it, we would all degenerate quickly into killers and thieves. This has been repeated so frequently and so consistently, that most people accept it as fact, even though if asked to provide evidence, they have none. Actual analysis of this idea leads to a contrary conclusion, but that does not stop the impulse of fear. Very few people have ever questioned the nation-state myth at all.\n\nI suggest that you print this out, take a few minutes, and think about it. I‚Äôll be in my office for several hours. Just let me know when you are ready.\n\n- Paul Rosenberg,  A Lodging of Wayfaring Men (p. 147-148)\n\n- - -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvfPI1t9Rck",

Because of that, we're making it opt-in, requiring that you SSH into your server and run:\n\ngit fetch\ngit checkout 2.0\nbtcpay-update.sh\n\nSeamless integration into existing systems remains one of our top priorities, and we‚Äôre excited to introduce three new e-commerce integrations that expand the possibilities for merchants:\n\n- Wix\n- Odoo\n- BigCommerce\n\nIf you use plugins with your BTCPay Server, you might notice that some are disabled after updates - we do that to prevent server crashes.\n\nIf you use plugins with your BTCPay Server, you may notice that some are disabled following updates - we do this to prevent server crashes.

Keep an eye on the upcoming minor releases that we‚Äôll ship if we notice any bugs. In the next few big releases we‚Äôre hoping to ship some of the most requested features that further enhance our mission.\n\nSuper-special shout out goes to our community testers, who went beyond and above testing the 2.0: @cypherpunkstore  nostr:npub1qqqqqq9tkeunk6ma4zdlgt4euev7p5c64jdmp7354x0zdrns3ars20hrhr  nostr:npub1k5f85zx0xdskyayqpfpc0zq6n7vwqjuuxugkayk72fgynp34cs3qfcvqg2 @JoinStrainly.\n\nWe hope you enjoy what this update has to offer.

    "content": "BitBox Lugano Update is here! üéâ\n\nAt BitBox, we want to make sure our users can take advantage of the newest innovations on Bitcoin. With today‚Äôs update, we are adding support for two great Bitcoin features:\n\n- Silent Payments\n- MiniTapscript\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfau.webp \n\nüîí¬†Silent Payments Upgrade\n\nWith this update, the BitBox02 is now the first hardware wallet to support sending to silent payment addresses. This means you can send bitcoin to the same address multiple times, without the sender losing privacy. No need to constantly generate new addresses!\n\nüîß Just enter a silent payment address in the BitBoxApp, and the transaction is created  together with your BitBox02. \n\nThe BitBoxApp then verifies the silent payment was created correctly by the BitBox02 for extra security.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfav.png \n\nüîë¬†This update also brings MiniTapscript, combining the privacy and efficiency of Taproot with the power of Miniscript. It‚Äôs perfect for creating more complex wallet setups like inheritance planning, while keeping transactions smaller and more private.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfaz.png \n\nWhat is MiniTapscript? \n\nMiniscript is a language that simplifies creating advanced Bitcoin spending conditions, like combining keys or setting time delays (great for inheritance planning).\n\nMiniTapscript adds Taproot‚Äôs privacy and efficiency to Miniscript. Only the part of the script actually used to spend the coins is revealed, which reduces transaction size, lowers fees, and improves privacy.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/LfbD.png \n\nWith MiniTapscript, only the necessary parts of the script are revealed, making transactions more efficient and lowering fees. It‚Äôs available now in firmware version 9.21.0.\n\nWhat else is included in our upgrade? Read more in the blogpost in the comment üëá",

Transactions with many outputs reveal that one user is making many payments.\n\n2. The value of each input and output. The mint uses a different key for each denomination value of the tokens. Thus a token worth 5 units is easily differentiated from a token worth 10 units. The anonymity set of a token depends on the number of tokens generated, so if a user is the only one with that specific denomination he has no privacy. \n\n3. The IP address that connects to the mint to send the transaction api request. If the same IP address makes multiple payments, it's likely the same user, and his geolocation is also revealed.\n\nProblems 1 and 2 can be mitigated on client side, but this adds substantial complexity in utxo management and transaction structure. If these mitigation are not specified and different clients have slightly different solutions, this opens up additional client fingerprinting attacks.\n\nWabiSabi is designed to solve problems 1 and 2 on a protocol level. A WabiSabi transaction is required to have exactly two inputs and two outputs, and homomorphic value commitments hide the amounts of each input and output. The tradeoff is that the mint has to issue 0 value credentials, a user needs to make more transactions to prepare his desired amounts, and the proof size and creation time is larger.\n\nProblem 3 is addressed by a client side networking anonymity layer. A VPN at least hides the actual users IP address, but if only one client uses this VPN to talk to this mint, it's still one IP per user. Tor is incredibly useful here, as it allows the creation of anonymous onion routes through the network with different exit IP addresses. A client can get a new IP for each api request! This does however increase bandwidth and latency cost.\n\nWe should assume \"everyone knows what the mint knows\", and so we need to be hardcore about privacy protections best baked into the protocol. If the protocol doesn't ensure the security of the user, client devs have to do an exponentially larger amount of research and development to fix the issues client side.",

I strongly believe authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans. Check üßµ for why:\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laim.png \n\nRather than praising bitcoin as a tech paradigm shift √† la petroleum and the internet, the authors introduce the blatantly luddite argument that \"early adopters\" ... \"increase their real wealth and consumption\" ... \"at the expense of [latecomers]\".\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lain.png \n\nThen they go on to brazenly advocate for legislation ... \"to prevent bitcoin prices from rising or to see bitcoin disappear altogether\" in order to prevent \"the division of society\".\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laio.png \n\nThe authors also model some projections, to illustrate the paltry amount of BTC that will remain available for latecomers. (Woe is me! Conspicuously left out is the reason that has driven 15 years of bitcoin adoption & development: it's simply better tech.)\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laiq.png \n\n In all the years I've been monitoring the bitcoin space, this is by far the most aggressive paper to come from authorities. The gloves are off. It's clear that these central bank economists now see bitcoin as an existential threat, to be attacked with any means possible.\n\nMany of us have warned that this was coming: bitcoin as a major political fault line both in national and international elections. Well here it is. It means that us HODLers must take action to insure that governments respect our basic right to hold property.\n\nAnd no, this won't be a war between haves and have-nots. Rather this will be a historic clash between those who stand for the natural rights of the individual, and those who clutch at the failed ideologies of collectivism and central planning.\n\nHere's the download link to the paper: \"The distributional consequences of Bitcoin\".

There has always been confusion over the word \"Free\" in \"Free Software\" and \"Open\" now suffers the same problem (look at all these LLM licenses claiming to be Open Source), and I think \"Freedom Tech\" is a pretty good way of talking about the same thing.\n\nThe Free/Libre Open Source Software community has a lot of overlap and similarity but can be split into two camps:\n\n1. I am truly free if I am allowed to contract myself into slavery (BSD-ish, permissive licensing).\n2. It is not freedom to be allowed to contract myself into slavery (GNU-ish, copyleft licensing).\n\nMaybe that's an unfair or unrealistic characterization but that's how I tend to think of it.\n\nI disagree with a lot of Stallman's views (he's on the left) but the four software freedoms are legit.

A note mixer relay - a simple yet intriguing concept. Essentially, it's a relay that accepts your notes, but instead of store them, it re-signs them with the relay's keys, effectively anonymizing and mixing your notes. This is the npub I'm using for this and where all mixed notes are published nostr:nprofile1qqs80keaa6v84ldnkne66q0qf96rvtf84aj27taw25x3appz83lqspgppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp07t6hp6 . \n\nThis idea isn't entirely new, there was some exploration around group of people sharing an nsec. This is the case of nostr:nprofile1qqswgh9y2cz5qu5upzg5yn47m65t7d697k2dtufa9fq54af80dwng5sprpmhxue69uhkummnw3ezucmgv95k6cfwd9hxvme0qyw8wumn8ghj7cn0wd68ytn0wfskuem9wdukuceww3jkx6p0ksrqpx, for example, it was created during sec01.\n\nIn summary, this note mixer relay will accept your notes, re-sign them with the relay's keys, and then publish them. Does this idea interest you, or does it make sense? Currently, anyone can publish to the relay, but I plan to implement a whitelist for pubkeys based on my contact list. This could also be integrated with a wot relay, allowing you to mix notes from your friends or entire social graph. Perhaps there are some interesting use cases to explore? ü§î\n\nJust a heads up: be careful not to publish to multiple relays, as this will leak your original note, signed by you.",

    "content": "Why I started Sovereign Landing\n\nI've been location independent for over 8 years. Nomadic lifestyle isn't easy, but Sovereign Landing solves my biggest pain...\n\nDuring these 8 years, at times I've attempted to have just one permanent base. Every time I try, reality seems to start sending me subtle or not-so-subtle hints that I shouldn't even be trying that... so I'm now leaning 100% into a semi-mobile lifestyle - permanently.\n\nI'm not constantly moving around because that would be just a ton of wasted energy, but I'm not living anywhere permanently either. A few different places per year.\n\nThis comes with some issues of course. Nomadic lifestyle is especially challenging over the long term - most people who try this just give up. Many find lack of community the worst aspect, but I've never really cared about that - my communities have always been online.\n\nWhat I personally find the most difficult is the actual moving - having to find a new apartment in a new country, and setting it up. That's tolerable to do maybe once, but the frustration compounds over time.\n\nThis happened again in the beginning of 2024. I was busy with life and knew I wanted to go to Tbilisi, Georgia, so I did. I just thought I'd get a temporary Airbnb while I find an actual longer-term rental. Should be easy, right?\n\nWell, it's never that simple, and that hit me once again when I started the apartment hunting process. I remembered vividly what absolute drain of energy it is. It usually means weeks of focus destroyed.\n\nThat's true even if you hire local help, as that hiring process by itself can be long and arduous! If the first person you hire can't get the job done (somewhat likely!) you have to start from scratch - fffffuuuuu...\n\nI did find a good reliable local person in Tbilisi (Nina), and during her apartment hunting I just couldn't help thinking \"if this thing here and that thing there was done slightly differently, this could be like 10-100x easier\". These things kept popping up in my head.\n\nNina was working as a real estate agent part time, and when she mentioned that she could have time for more customers, I just put 1+1+1 together.\n\nI know something about online marketing. Nina is an expert on the local market. And I'm definitely an expert on taking sort-of-functional processes, ripping them apart and turning them into great customer experiences. That's how the idea of Sovereign Landing got started!\n\nI've been building this project primarily with myself as the primary customer avatar, but it's now high time to start getting some market feedback from OTHER people - preferably customers! üòÄ\n\nI'd highly appreciate it if you can check out the site and let me hear your thoughts?\n\nhttps://www.sovereignlanding.com/",

This part of the conversation was such gold that I made it into a separate clip: https://m.primal.net/LJjL.mp4 \n\nThis part of the conversation is about the book Second Realm: https://libertyunderattack.com/product/second-realm-book-on-strategy/ (you can download and listen to it for free)\n\nMy highlights from the conversation in text:\n\n[Gsovereignty]\n\n...We can also orange-pill the world by hiring everyone...\n\n[Max]\nYeah, cause ultimately free people are productive people and productive people want to build stuff...\n\nNot just do we need to produce services and goods in the 2nd realm that cannot be acquired in the 1st realm, but likewise there is a demand in the 2nd realm that cannot be provided or satisfied in the 1st realm... and so then 1st realm agents will migrate into the 2nd realm in order to produce those goods and services for 2nd realm inhabitants.\n\n[Gsovereignty]\nI think I will take that hint and start referring to the bitcoin world as the 2nd realm\n\n[Max]\nYeah it's a perfect fit...\n\n... (Second Realm) It's a book on strategy, how to build a productive parallel society that gets humanity through this dark time of parasitism. We need to have people continuously producing, DESPITE the enormous amount of theft that is going on, and we need to build tools and strategies that make being productive cheaper.\n\nThere is a gigantic demand in this area, and therefore huge opportunities for value creation and profit.\n\nSo, this is ultimately I think what is going for us, like back during the Soviet regime: you had the Soviet economy, centrally planned and everything going to shit and rotting and no value being created at all, and you had the much more liberal western societies with more free market producing enormous amounts of incredible things.\n\nYou just see the two markets and centrally planned slavery societies always underperform property-rights based freedom societies, like always has, always been, will always be... just because of economic reality.\n\nSo in the long run we will see exactly the same thing happening again: the first realm, centrally managed, fiat-controlled and slave/theft based system is going to dwindle and further decrease in capital.\n\nIt will devour itself more and more, and as it is dying it will have to devour itself even at a faster rate, just to keep up. While simultaneously the free world will produce things that we cannot even yet imagine, at a scale we cannot even fathom...\n\n...and that will continue to increase, as we continue to write the code that decreases the cost for doing so, and we're not stopping to write the code!\n\nThe full episode is here: https://fountain.fm/episode/1UPPuhyd3St7E3RCpBsX",

    "content": "NEW CLIENT ANNOUNCEMENT\nhttps://m.primal.net/LDNn.mp4 \nI wanted to build on nostr and I asked OpenSats for a grant to work on ONOSENDAI one day per week. I scaled back my hours at my fiat job and began part time nostr development to work on a novel metaverse project where all actions require proof of work. This was the beginning of my nostr career. Today is a huge milestone in that journey.\n\nIt took me 52 Fridays from proof of concept to reality, and now ONOSENDAI functions as the first cyberspace client.\n\nToday I present to you the thermodynamic update to #ONOSENDAI https://onosendai.tech\n#welcometocyberspace folks. It's finally here. Check it out on desktop for the best experience. More updates for a better Mobile experience are in the pipeline.\n\nI'm working on a video to explain cyberspace and how to use ONOSENDAI and I'll post it ASAP.\n\nThe short tutorial is this:\n- WASD for movement (relative to camera)\n- Q = down, E = up\n- ESC to put camera behind avatar\n- Mouse Click and drag to move camera\n- Mouse Wheel to change Throttle\n\nSections of the app:\n\nLOCAL\nThis is the on-the-ground cyberspace view. The shiny polygon you begin your journey in is your Home Coordinate, which is simply your hex pubkey. Your journey always starts here if you derezz (or get derezzed) at any point, but your progress is saved to nostr and your avatar will travel even when you're away from the app!\n\nSECTOR\nThis is the 10,000ft view of cyberspace. Nearby sectors are automatically scanned for objects of interest and mapped in 3D: other avatars, hyperjumps, shards, and constructs (coming soon).\n\nGLOBAL\nThis is the 100,000,000ft view of cyberspace. The staggeringly large full coordinate system is shown.\n\nBUILD\nThis tab is a 3D editor that lets you build 3D objects called Shards. Shards can be mined and planted wherever you are at in cyberspace for everyone to admire. In the LOCAL tab you can mine and deploy a Shard at your current position. The size and complexity of the shard determines its mining difficulty.\n\nTerminology:\n\n- coord - a cyberspace coordinate is a 256-bit number, just like event ids and public keys.\n- chain - the nostr events representing your movement which contain proof-of-work and are linked together via hash\n- sector - a 2^30 cube area of cyberspace\n- G - Gibson, the unit of measurement in cyberspace named after William Gibson (the author who invented the concept of cyberspace)\n- plane - The last bit in a cyberspace coordinate determines its plane. Depending on your pubkey you will either be in D-Space or I-Space. You will be able to switch planes in a future update. All points in D-Space map to a real point in reality, including Earth. All points in I-Space are virtual.\n\nDespite the polish I was able to muster, ONOSENDAI is still in its infancy, and so is cyberspace. It's up to you to explore, build, discover, and push it forward, because unlike other metaverses, this one belongs to everyone and is controlled by no-one. That's the whole point!\n\nI would like to invite all #cyberspace enthusiasts to join my new ditto instance at https://straylight.cafe and use your nostr identity to ask questions, discuss cyberspace, futurism, and how to build this new world together. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. I want to shut down the ONOSENDAI telegram group in favor of Straylight Caf√© because it's nostr based, so hop on over and make it happen!\n\nWhen you join Straylight.cafe, it isn't connected to any external relays on purpose, so you must edit your profile and customize it for how you want your npub to appear on this site. Whatever you post on Straylight stays there and doesn't go out to the rest of nostr unless you do so manually. It's like an open telegram group -- public, but not broadcasted by default.\n\nAnd so concludes my OpenSats grant. I want to thank so many people for supporting me, encouraging me, and helping me along this journey.\nI am going to try to list everyone I can and I apologize if I miss someone:\nOpenSats and the whole team there\nGsovereignty and Bitkarrot for having me on their podcast. This was a huge break for me into the nostr scene.\nJohns and Marina for encouraging me and inviting me to awesome bolt.fun hackathons which were a wonderful opportunity to meet great people!\nbnonni for being my first ONOSENDAI contributor\nChris for donating to support my work on cyberspace\nlaoc42 \n42pupusas for being the first to build on the cyberspace protocol\nCryptoClay for his enthusiasm and support\nNik, for bringing life and sound to cyberspace with his videos\nPablo for bragging about me and sharing his contagious enthusiasm\nJeffG for answering my NDK questions and being a good bro\nSimon for donating to support my work on cyberspace\nthe FanFares team\nAVERAGE_GARY for thoughtful consideration and friendship\nArtur Brugeman\nJ@n, for having me on his podcast and being an awesome friend\nIoni Appleberg\nMichael Tidwell\nSer Sleepy\nJay\nQuiet Warrior\nAvi\nholdbod\nhzrd149\nMax\nMax Hillebrand\nbiscuits\nmetamick and paula\njonb\nshaun, isaac, yofu, and the yakihonne crew. They throw great hackathons and are wonderful people!\njeanpaul\nFiatjaf\nhttps://m.primal.net/LFjl.png\nStephen Mosher and his crew\nall of my faithful and beloved reply guys who hype me up when I post about cyberspace\nEveryone in the telegram group and everyone who has zapped, tested, and waited patiently for this\nEveryone who believed in me and the skeptics who pushed me to the finish line\n\nThis is just the beginning. Nostr isn't just for tweets. It's for cyberspace, and I think that's a big deal. Thanks everyone üëæüíú\n\n#OTHERSTUFF",

    "content": "Amen.\n\nThis world we live in.. I didn‚Äôt sign up for it.  It was forced upon me.  Some days it just becomes too much.  I have taken my fair share of incoming arrows.  Some of those arrows were, and continue to be, unjust.  Some of those arrows were of my own causing.  I am not perfect.\n\nI don‚Äôt want a perfect world.  I want a world where I‚Äôm not reliant upon the desires of others to control and extort me and where I‚Äôm respected enough to be left alone to do my thing so long as it doesn‚Äôt harm others unjustly.\n\nThe desire to effect this declaration already exists in many of us.  No sane person likes to be controlled or have impositions forced upon him or her.  At the end of the day, we the people give others the power to do things against us.  We sit in relatively quiet outrage, not wanting to rock the boat, not wanting others to perceive us as crazy, and not doing anything about it.  Though, in a sense, participating in #Nostr and #Bitcoin is doing something about it.  It‚Äôs setting a direction toward what we believe is a better and more just society for us to live.  For this I am encouraged that the options are available to each of us to participate or not as we see fit in a way that has not been available to us before.\n\nDecentralization may seem like chaos to some, but that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt yet understand what it is and means.  They don‚Äôt understand that these systems are about taking back control from the privileged few.  The proof is in the pudding.  Our systems seem to be working.  Each of us are free to participate or not in these decentralized systems.  We know the rules ahead of time and we know that change is truly of consensus, rather than this fake show the ruling class foists upon us without consideration of our input or desires. nostr:note10qp726g4zffsgs05l83a5e7hx42rsqhx4urvmtg6g8xtnu4qxjpsgaxy4d",

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice.

Spending a taproot input is 16% cheaper compared to spending a native segwit input. Users aren‚Äôt the only ones that benefit - Bitcoin nodes can verify taproot‚Äôs signatures faster than legacy ones, so the entire network gets a little speed boost.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/KvGi.png \n\nüöÄ Faster transaction broadcasting\n\nA more sophisticated transaction broadcasting mechanism was introduced to make the process faster. Transactions are now broadcast to multiple nodes in parallel (through the Tor network) and fail more quickly if the transaction is rejected by the network. Users who upgrade will notice it now takes half as long to send their coins.\n\nüîç Help to setup and find a coordinator\n\nA new message is now shown when no coordinator is configured, along with some help to understand how to find and setup one.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/KvGe.png \n\n‚è´ More accurate CPFP fee estimation\n\nThe CPFP feature now takes into account the fee paid by the parent transaction. In previous releases, the child transaction assumed the parent paid 0 sats in fees, and thus always overpaid for the speed up.. This improvement will be especially significant in high-fee environments, where the CPFP feature is most useful!\n\nüìâ Safer protocol\n\nIn order to avoid introducing unknown incentives and to limit risk to users, the coordination fee concept has been removed. Only coinjoin coordinators that don't charge any coordination fee continue to be supported. Read more: https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/killing-coordination-fee/\n\nü™≤ Backend optimizations\n\nUsers who run a Wasabi backend can now do so with a pruned node and significant CPU/RAM savings. This makes hosting a backend much cheaper and helps to decentralize this component which Wasabi clients still depend on.",

Trading in foreign currency is illegal and businesses are subject to rationing. As a result, there is a growing black market for everything.\n\nElliot Vreeland, son of Nobel Laureate Austrian School economist Dr. Martin Vreeland, learns of his father's apparent death, and is rushed home from school. Elliot learns his father has faked his death to escape arrest by the government agents who are detaining \"radicals\" accused of worsening the economic crisis. Elliot is sent by his father to collect some gold coins stored in case the family has to escape.\n\nUpon returning home, Elliot finds his family missing. Government agents enter the house searching for Elliot, who manages to escape.\n\nElliot becomes acquainted with the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre, an organization plotting the end of the government agents by means of counter-economics. The cadre is strong and organized, and has its militia. Elliot enlists their help, and meets Lorimer, a girl hiding from the government agents; they develop a relationship.\n\nAs the government agents weaken, they tighten controls on communication, travel, and trade. This fails to avert economic collapse, causing the private sector ‚Äì unions, syndicates, and individuals outside of these organizations ‚Äì to control the old infrastructure.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alongside_Night",

I joined them a few times because there wasn‚Äôt much else to do, but for them, it was something a bit more serious‚Äîit was a small but important source of income that they gave to their mothers. It was easy work, and customers appreciated it and tip them for their help.\n\nThen, one day, someone decided to prohibit all forms of child labor. A few years later, the streets were full of kids cleaning car windows, others tried playing violin, singing on the sidewalks or simply asking for money, activities that noone find valuable. \n\nThe sense of pride my friend once had from earning a few pesos by providing a useful service had now been replaced by a naturalized shame of relying on pity from strangers.",

This is the default level and is usually used by people who don't know or don't care about signature levels. A lot of people don't specify the signature level when they sign public keys, so there is no reason to discard these right away.\n\nLevel 1 signature: personal belief but no verification. As the name says this level is used when someone signs a key but was unable to verify the identity. Used for nicknames, most of the time, as you can't really prove the identity behind a pseudonym. Be careful when you encounter a level 1 signature on a key with a full name and e-mail address. These levels have to be specified manually, if someone changes it to level 1, it might be for a reason.\n\nLevel 2 signature: casual verification: These signatures usually mean that people have met and checked identification, but didn't know eachother upfront.\n\nLevel 3 signature: extensive verification: The level used when the signer was absolutely sure that the listed name is correct. Usually this means that they have known eachother in person for years and have checked government issues identification.\n\nhttps://vic.demuzere.be/articles/pgp-public-keys/",

    "content": "A train of thought coming from: \"we can't do ZKPs using sigma protocols or bulletproofs on chain, because we only have ECC operations against one generator (G)\":\n\nImagine one of the very simplest things you can do with 2 generators: proof of discrete log equivalence or DLEQ for short. This is basically the simplest possible generalization of Schnorr; one secret, two bases. This requires two ephemeral commitments (the nonce k mult. the 2 generators) and only one scalar response (one \"signature\", if you like).\n\nOf course, you can't verify such a thing on chain; you can't check sJ = R_2 + hash(..)Q where Q = xJ and P = xG. You can only verify the first version, w.r.t. G: sG = R + eP, which is ofc standard Schnorr, here bip340.\n\nBut .. is there a way adaptors could help? Because an adaptor is something you verify offchain, and so it isn't restricted to one base/ generator.\n\nImagine your goal is \"unlock a payment only if P and Q have the same DL wrt G, J\" (yes I know, bizarre, but I'm fumbling towards the first sentence, here).\n\nObviously if we're including \"verify something offchain before taking an action\", we'll find it sanest to stick to a 2 party protocol first. Let's see:\n\n1. Alice sends Bob P, Q, R1, R2 (having calculated from a random k, R1 = kG, R2 =kJ, and already knowing x_a s.t. Q=x_a J and P=x_a G); her private key is x_a\n2. Alice pays into a 2-2 multisig with Bob, where her key is P, and the aggregate key is Pagg, with U1. When Alice signs it (not yet), the signature will look like:\n\ns_a = k1 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x_a\n\nNotice the +T which will be for an adaptor that Alice adds. This process is already well understood for Schnorr multisig. I am glossing over Musig related details, claiming they don't change the following.\n\n3. Alice provides an adaptor over J for ``spending'' U1. Before writing this out, consider: we want the s-value to be the same over J as it is over G. This is problematic, because the s value comes from a structure that is basically : s = k + e*x, where e is the hash, and as per bip340, that hash *must* be exactly: H(R, P, m) where P is the onchain key, R is the onchain nonce and m is the actual transaction message. So if we do things naively, i.e. make an adaptor over the J base like:\n\ns'J = R2 + H(R2+T, Q, message)Q\n\n.. then we're going to fail to create the desired scenario: that the real signature 's' is the same between the J and G bases. In order to solve this we have to play a trick. We don't change the nonce or public key fields in the hash at all, i.e. we do:\n\ns' = k2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x\n\nand have Bob verify:\n\ns'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q\n\nSuperficially that is unsound; the reason is that such signatures can be forged if the corresponding nonce point R2 is not fixed into the hash/FS challenge, which it appears it isn't (also not \"key-prefixing\" by including the public key, here Q, in the same challenge is, at the least, problematic). However this can be solved, albeit in an unorthodox way: include both R2 and Q, which are curve points, as data inside the bitcoin transaction! (spending U1). It will just be \"dead\" data (e.g. OP_DROP) because you won't be able to sign against them; they use the wrong basepoint, but it is still easy).\n\n4. Bob verifies this adaptor using (to repeat): s'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q.\n5. Now Bob knows that if he sees the valid s for this equation, he gets the private key t of T w.r.t. J. Importantly, he also knows that if that one s corresponds to the s that is needed to spend U1, then Q and P have the discrete log equivalence property we are proving. But simply convincing Bob of a fact like that is uninteresting in itself; you can do that by simply directly sending him ZKPs of various types. So, :\n6. Alice also provides offchain a DLEQ proof that T = tJ and T2 = tG\n7. Alice makes another adaptor on a payment of another utxo U2, using the same t: s'_2 = k_3 + H(R_3 + T2, P2, m)P2.\n8. Bob now knows that if U1 is spent, it reveals s, proves that DL Q/J = P/G, and that he can spend U2 using s_2 = s'_2 + t, having extracted t from s - s', and knowing that that t value corresponds to T2.\n\nThis could be seen as \"just an adaptor based atomic swap with a bunch of extra steps\", but I'd call it more \"atomic swap gated by DLEQ\", i.e. it will fail unless Q/J = P/G holds.\n\n",

    "content": "Just to define a term (because my pedantic nature recoils at the phrase \"Righteous coercion\") \nCoercion:\n1. The act or practice of coercing. \n2. Power or ability to coerce. \n3. The act or process of coercing. \n4. The application to another of either physical or moral force. When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced. When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact of submission under force. ‚ÄúCoactus volui‚Äù (I consented under compulsion) is the condition of mind which, when there is volition forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion.\n5. Actual or threatened force for the purpose of compelling action by another person; the act of coercing.\n6. Use of physical or moral force to compel a person to do something, or to abstain from doing something, thereby depriving that person of the exercise of free will.\n7. A specific instance of coercing.\n8. Conversion of a value of one data type to a value of another data type. \n9. Using force to cause something to occur. \n\nAs far as my moral understanding none of these definitions can be performed righteously. What I think you are refering to as coercion may very well be defined as just ownership or property rights. When one is said to \"own\" something that is to say they have authoritative control of the use, maintenance, and right to exchange. Your dominion is your property. (God's dominion is everthing and God is the Progenator) Within one's property rule enforcement is not coercion because those on your property have been invited and thus agree to those rules. One cannot agree to coercion. \n\nWhen it comes to government, the only way one might say you \"Agree to the rules\" of citizenship, is to be under the illusion that you chose the government. That IS an illusion. You may be complicit in the government's actions but you have not chosen anything. This lack of free will to choose IS coercion regardless of perceptions of divinity. The scriptures are inspired by God and written by men. In so doing, they are limited by man's understanding of societal structure and dominion. It could very well be that when a polity is made of wicked men, they make a wicked government. But it is not at all clear to me, that individuals working in their own endeavors freely and collaboratively exchanging their goods and services, need a governance structure outside of their moral adherence to God's will. There is no place for interference from the state even if it could somehow act righteously (again I am unsure how taking money without permission can be righteous given the commandment expressly forbidding it.) That claim to Righteous coercion IS the illusion to which I was referring. \n\nI hope that clarifies where I seem to diverge with your view point. Peace and love, Brother.",

Still, if my kids were to do something illegal in public or to someone from a different family, the local authorities would have dominion over justice.\n\nHowever, for justice (and many other things like education/moral formation) within my family, I can exclude a father from another family from intervening in our affairs or, more importantly, excluding the state from teaching things I disapprove of. So, in that sense, I have a monopoly in my position of authority in the family.\n\nThis nuance is articulated as subsidiarity in the Catholic tradition: the principle that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, with higher authorities intervening only when necessary. The concept goes back to at least the 13th century with St. Thomas Aquinas‚Äôs Summa Theologica, but Pope Pius XI used it specifically in his papal encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, which is an important document in the history of Catholic Social Teaching.",

He then deligates authority to lesser powers‚Äîto his heavenly host (like angels) as well as mankind. \n\nMan as God's image bearer is to take dominion of the earth‚Äîto cultivate, subdue, and rule (as God's governors). \n\nGod also subdivided his deligated authority to man into four primary forms of government‚Äîthe church, the magistrate (state), the family, and the individual. Each government has its own specific roles and boundaries‚Äîclergy do not declare war, the magistrate does not administer the sacraments, for example. \n\nWhen man sinned and fell, and all creation was subject to sin, man's governing roles and duties did not change but are now plagued with corruption. Even in a sinful world God did not do away with government. Rather, we are told that God gave the magistrate the sword to reward the just and to punish the unjust. \n\nIn 2 Samuel God says \"When one rules justly over man, ruling in the fear of God, he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass sprout from the earth\"\n\nIn proverbs 29:2, it says \"When the rightelus increase, the people flourish, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.\"\n\nUltimately we are all under the authority and rule of Christ, whether we accept that reality or not, but not accepting it as a peoples results in evil rulers. \n\nWe individually, as households, even as towns and communities and states, can and should resist evil rulers. Part of that resistance is writing code and using open protocols (nostr) and better money (bitcoin). But the heart of that resistance needs to be repentance and a return to rightly ordered rule under the ultimate lordship of Christ.",

She understood that it was no more difficult or time-consuming for her as a cashier than paying by card. \n\nWhy am I writing this to you? \n\nIf we want to live the bitcoin standard, we need more merchants who accept bitcoin. And we need more bitcoiners to pay with sats. It is neither difficult nor forbidden. It is the decision of each and every one of us.  \n\nThis is the only way we can establish a circular economy. \n\nnostr:nevent1qqsdg46nd4q6exqnj53v9s3a7uuhz8x54lrywuhtg22dxx67f50qr6qpz4mhxue69uhkummnw3ezummcw3ezuer9wchsygrwg6zz9hahfftnsup23q3mnv5pdz46hpj4l2ktdpfu6rhpthhwjvpsgqqqqqqs7dvlys",

    "content": "I've been thinking this through and I've encountered two closely related problems. My outline of the naive approach is: see the \"Vcash\" section of the Curve Trees paper. The \"pour\" algorithm already does most of what you want. You build a tree of utxo pubkeys, more exactly tags of the form G__nll =hash(pubkey)G_t to use the notation of the paper. Then for each of yours, you build the commitment as C_i = v_iG_v + G_nll_i + r_i H where v is the value of the coin and r_i is a random chosen by the prover to blind the commitment. So far so normal. Then you use CurveTrees' \"Selectandrerandomise\" algo to get C_rr,i (rr means 're-randomized' commitment) along with a proof of its validity (i.e. a proof that it's in the tree.\n\nAfter doing this for every one of your utxos, you then need to attach a second zero knowledge proof, a minor adaptation of \"pour\" in Fig 6 of the paper: instead of proving zero balance from summing ins and outs in a transaction, you prove \"commitment to my claimed balance minus the sum of commitments to the list I've given has value 0\". You also need to attach a range proof for each one of the outputs, but this is also handled by spend/pour in the paper.\n\nBut in that lies the problem: if I claim an exact amount, say 100 BTC, and I have to provide a list of N utxos, I've provided already too much information, in the general case: with a very specific amount and a number it's almost trivial (usually) to crunch the public utxo set and figure out the subset that gives the exactly correct total sum. I only see two directions to correct this problem. Use a proof of range instead of exact balance (prove x > y instead of x == y), but this can be surprisingly much more difficult than proving exact values in zero knowledge. Or, some form of aggregation to avoid leaking the number of items (so instead of one c_rr per one of your keys, somehow aggregating the selectandrerandomize? not sure if that actually even makes sense ...).\n\n\nnostr:nevent1qqs90g0yjyl3a4k28tqed65fpuynn06gu6566n2x4ndftwz33ft7w4cpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsrz0tl7",

To recap:\n\nyou want to prove that you own a total of T BTC, but privately. But revealing exact amount may make it too easy to deanon. So I have a proof of this statement: \"I own N utxos, whose total value is between k and k + 2^n, for some k and n that I announce, but I am not revealing which N utxos they are, or what their individual values is, out of a given list of 300k utxos\". The code at https://github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct/tree/auditing now does this.\n\nSee the latest commit note. In brief you need 3 or 4 components to the proof: 1/ a proof that each blinded commitment is part of that 300k set, 2/a proof that each committed value, when summed together, lies in the given range (using bulletproofs), and 3/ key images per utxo to ensure you dont' cheat by just claiming the same utxo multiple times.\n\nnostr:nevent1qqsqc8wgf8w74sh2sjfpjgw4lpp7sp08vfvgpc7dvljewn3cq4grscgpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsxpc8jd",

    "content": "NWS works with and without encrypted transport. There are lots of different flavors to explore. \n\nWhen used without encryption, the entry node must be run by the user themselves because public entry nodes would be able to listen in otherwise. Two options in those cases: run the entry node locally in tandem with your (unmodified) client, or skip the entry node and modify the client so that data is sent through nostr to the exit node directly (the client is the entry node).\n\nWhen used with encryption, the entry node can also be public. If the encryption doesn't rely on certificate authorities, it just works. You have to make sure you're talking to the right person, but that problem is as old as computer science. For example, ssh will ask you to confirm the fingerprint of the server when you connect.\n\nIf the encryption is https and the certificate was issued for a normal domain, your browser will complain (do you trust this website?) and the user will have to say \"let me pass, even if insecure\". Without ugly hacks (issuing your own root cert for example), I don't know ways to circumvent this. Note that Tor services doen't support https and they don't have to since transport is always Sphinx-encrypted (even hidden from the entry node).\n\nHow do you make sure you're talking to the right server if you use https? Couldn't the entry node just send your traffic somewhete else? We can actually do something that is unique to Nostr here: the exit node can publish its own TLS certificate on nostr and sign it. That's right, you don't need an authority to do that for you if you remain within the NWS system. Clients can fetch the cert from nostr before talking to the entry node and verify against that cert. \n\nHere is another cool part that we haven't talked about yet: the exit node can also be configured to reach the global Internet and not only a local service (we call this NWS v2). In those cases, NWS can be used a bit like a VPN. You can type \"https google dot com\" in your browser and your encrypted traffic would flow from your machine to the entry node, to the exit node, then to Google and back to you. on those cases, nobody complains about the certificate because everything is fine.\n\n\nExciting shit.

Do not delay.\n\n- Use a strong, high entropy passphrase to make bruteforcing the device credential impossible if secure element is ever exploited.\n\n- Set GrapheneOS auto reboot time accordingly so encrypted data goes back at rest when the phone reboots, which makes AFU exploitation impossible. The lower the better.\n\n- Enable duress password. Set it to something easy to trigger but not easy to misfire.\n\n- Turn your phone off in a high risk situation, and trigger duress when in a duress situation.\n\n- Disable your radios when not using them (turn off Wi-Fi, use airplane mode, disable NFC, UWB etc.) for attack surface reduction.\n\n- Set an appropriate USB port control or disable the USB port so they aren't able to connect a device to it.\n\n- Use user profiles (application data and user files within profiles are stored encrypted with separate credentials).\n\n- Enable upcoming GrapheneOS security features like second factor authentication unlock when they come out.\n\n- Communicate only over secure messaging. Some apps like Molly (Signal fork) have features to encrypt the app storage with a passphrase, which access to that app's data impossible even when a profile is compromised  providing the passphrase is secure enough.\n\n- Become disassociated to data. Learn to only keep files or other data as long as it is necessary. If you have no use for them for a long time, then back it up elsewhere, encrypted. Delete anything you don't have a use for in the present. Your data is not your memories. \n\n- Remember that you are only as secure as the people you trust.

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

With NWS, you can host any existing web application on Nostr without having to use DNS or even announce your public IP to the world, simply by sharing your service's npub (or nprofile).\n\nTry it out the demo yourself. Here is a Cashu test mint running with NWS. Let's use curl to retrieve the mint's information. The request travels from your computer to the public NWS entry relay, then through nostr to the service's NWS exit relay. At the other end is a Cashu mint with HTTPS encryption.\n\n```\ncurl -s -x socks5h://relay.8333.space:8882 https://nprofile1qqs8a8nk09fhrxylcd42haz8ev4cprhnk5egntvs0whafvaaxpk8plgpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuwpnxvejuumsv93k2g6k9kr/v1/info --insecure | jq\n```\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTMl.png \n\nI can't stress this enough: THE MINT RUNS BEHIND HTTPS!\n\nThe NWS entry relay can't read your traffic. It's encrypted. We can host public entry relays that can be used by anyone.\n\nThis means we can plug the entire internet to it üåê.\n\nLet's plug it into Cashu for now. Nutshell wallet supports socks5 proxies (that's how it uses Tor). By setting the public entry relay as the proxy, the wallet can now connect to a mint's npub/nprofile and communicate with it via NWS.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTot.png \n\nThis is going to be so freaking cool. And it's going to be a lot more useful than just for Cashu. There are still bugs and issues that need to be ironed out but the code is coming out soon. Watch this space.",

But inside that is *another* encrypted blob (onionmsg_tlv.encrypted_recipient_data), which requires a tweak which was handed to you alongside the onion, for you to decrypt (into an \"encrypted_data_tlv\").  Inside that is all the information about where to send next, any restrictions, and allows you to calculate the *next* tweak to hand on (it can also override the next tweak).\n\nThe double encryption is necessary because there are *three* actors here: Alice wants Bob to send her a message, without revealing her identity. So she gives Bob a \"blinded path\" which goes via Charlie: this path contains Charlie's pubkey (where to start the path), a blinding tweak, and two encrypted blobs for Alice to put into each layer of the onion message.  The first an encrypted blob which Charlie can read, which contains her pubkey so he knows where to send it next.  The second is her own, and contains a secret specific to the purpose of this message, so Bob can't play games trying to use this blinded path for anything else (\"hey, are you the same node as this previous payment?\") or use a different blinded path for this purpose.  She can also add dummy hops (we don't yet), which she will simply absorb, to obscure the path length from Bob.  You can add padding to make the hops indistinguishable (we don't yet).\n\nBob puts the actual stuff he wants to send Alice into the final onion call (often including his own blinded reply path!), along with the encrypted blob.\n\nImportantly, even if Bob were sending a message *not through a blinded path* he would use the same double-encrypted format: that's so Charlie can't tell whether a blinded path is being used or not, even though it's slightly less efficient.  Crypto is cheap these days, too.\n\nNow, if Alice gives Bob a blinded path to Charlie and Charlie is Bob's peer, he can simply send the onion and the first blinding tweak to Charlie.  But if Alice needs to send the message via Dave to Charlie, she needs to prepend a step.  That's not quite possible, naively, because blinding tweaks are generated *forwards*, and she needs Charlie to get the right blinding tweak from Dave, and Alice has no way of making that happen.  So inside Dave's encrypted blob, she uses next_blinding_override to tell Dave to hand that blinding override to Charlie instead of the normal one.  I just implemented this for Core Lightning (previously we would simply connect to the first node, which is privacy-compromising and should only be done as a last resort).\n\nThese blinded paths have some nice properties: you can't use part of them (you don't know the blinding factor except for the first one, so you can't start in the middle, and you can't replace any data), you need to use all of them.  They can contain timelimits to avoid easy probing, too: a classic measure would be to see if the path fails when a given node is down, but that takes time.  The spec insists all errors within the blinded path are the same, and originate from the entry: this loses some analytical power on failure, but makes probing harder.  The entry point is supposed to add a random delay (we don't yet!).  There may still be implementation differences, but they're hard for Bob to probe (and Alice doesn't need to, as she set up the path).\n",
