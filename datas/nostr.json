Sometimes, when I looked for my neighbor friends to go play, they weren‚Äôt home because they were working at the supermarket three blocks away, bagging groceries at the cashier line. I joined them a few times because there wasn‚Äôt much else to do, but for them, it was something a bit more serious‚Äîit was a small but important source of income that they gave to their mothers. It was easy work, and customers appreciated it and tip them for their help.\n\nThen, one day, someone decided to prohibit all forms of child labor. A few years later, the streets were full of kids cleaning car windows, others tried playing violin, singing on the sidewalks or simply asking for money, activities that noone find valuable. \n\nThe sense of pride my friend once had from earning a few pesos by providing a useful service had now been replaced by a naturalized shame of relying on pity from strangers.",

This is the default level and is usually used by people who don't know or don't care about signature levels. A lot of people don't specify the signature level when they sign public keys, so there is no reason to discard these right away.\n\nLevel 1 signature: personal belief but no verification. As the name says this level is used when someone signs a key but was unable to verify the identity. Used for nicknames, most of the time, as you can't really prove the identity behind a pseudonym. Be careful when you encounter a level 1 signature on a key with a full name and e-mail address. These levels have to be specified manually, if someone changes it to level 1, it might be for a reason.\n\nLevel 2 signature: casual verification: These signatures usually mean that people have met and checked identification, but didn't know eachother upfront.\n\nLevel 3 signature: extensive verification: The level used when the signer was absolutely sure that the listed name is correct. Usually this means that they have known eachother in person for years and have checked government issues identification.\n\nhttps://vic.demuzere.be/articles/pgp-public-keys/",

    "content": "A train of thought coming from: \"we can't do ZKPs using sigma protocols or bulletproofs on chain, because we only have ECC operations against one generator (G)\":\n\nImagine one of the very simplest things you can do with 2 generators: proof of discrete log equivalence or DLEQ for short. This is basically the simplest possible generalization of Schnorr; one secret, two bases. This requires two ephemeral commitments (the nonce k mult. the 2 generators) and only one scalar response (one \"signature\", if you like).\n\nOf course, you can't verify such a thing on chain; you can't check sJ = R_2 + hash(..)Q where Q = xJ and P = xG. You can only verify the first version, w.r.t. G: sG = R + eP, which is ofc standard Schnorr, here bip340.\n\nBut .. is there a way adaptors could help? Because an adaptor is something you verify offchain, and so it isn't restricted to one base/ generator.\n\nImagine your goal is \"unlock a payment only if P and Q have the same DL wrt G, J\" (yes I know, bizarre, but I'm fumbling towards the first sentence, here).\n\nObviously if we're including \"verify something offchain before taking an action\", we'll find it sanest to stick to a 2 party protocol first. Let's see:\n\n1. Alice sends Bob P, Q, R1, R2 (having calculated from a random k, R1 = kG, R2 =kJ, and already knowing x_a s.t. Q=x_a J and P=x_a G); her private key is x_a\n2. Alice pays into a 2-2 multisig with Bob, where her key is P, and the aggregate key is Pagg, with U1. When Alice signs it (not yet), the signature will look like:\n\ns_a = k1 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x_a\n\nNotice the +T which will be for an adaptor that Alice adds. This process is already well understood for Schnorr multisig. I am glossing over Musig related details, claiming they don't change the following.\n\n3. Alice provides an adaptor over J for ``spending'' U1. Before writing this out, consider: we want the s-value to be the same over J as it is over G. This is problematic, because the s value comes from a structure that is basically : s = k + e*x, where e is the hash, and as per bip340, that hash *must* be exactly: H(R, P, m) where P is the onchain key, R is the onchain nonce and m is the actual transaction message. So if we do things naively, i.e. make an adaptor over the J base like:\n\ns'J = R2 + H(R2+T, Q, message)Q\n\n.. then we're going to fail to create the desired scenario: that the real signature 's' is the same between the J and G bases. In order to solve this we have to play a trick. We don't change the nonce or public key fields in the hash at all, i.e. we do:\n\ns' = k2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x\n\nand have Bob verify:\n\ns'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q\n\nSuperficially that is unsound; the reason is that such signatures can be forged if the corresponding nonce point R2 is not fixed into the hash/FS challenge, which it appears it isn't (also not \"key-prefixing\" by including the public key, here Q, in the same challenge is, at the least, problematic). However this can be solved, albeit in an unorthodox way: include both R2 and Q, which are curve points, as data inside the bitcoin transaction! (spending U1). It will just be \"dead\" data (e.g. OP_DROP) because you won't be able to sign against them; they use the wrong basepoint, but it is still easy).\n\n4. Bob verifies this adaptor using (to repeat): s'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q.\n5. Now Bob knows that if he sees the valid s for this equation, he gets the private key t of T w.r.t. J. Importantly, he also knows that if that one s corresponds to the s that is needed to spend U1, then Q and P have the discrete log equivalence property we are proving. But simply convincing Bob of a fact like that is uninteresting in itself; you can do that by simply directly sending him ZKPs of various types. So, :\n6. Alice also provides offchain a DLEQ proof that T = tJ and T2 = tG\n7. Alice makes another adaptor on a payment of another utxo U2, using the same t: s'_2 = k_3 + H(R_3 + T2, P2, m)P2.\n8. Bob now knows that if U1 is spent, it reveals s, proves that DL Q/J = P/G, and that he can spend U2 using s_2 = s'_2 + t, having extracted t from s - s', and knowing that that t value corresponds to T2.\n\nThis could be seen as \"just an adaptor based atomic swap with a bunch of extra steps\", but I'd call it more \"atomic swap gated by DLEQ\", i.e. it will fail unless Q/J = P/G holds.\n\n",

    "content": "Just to define a term (because my pedantic nature recoils at the phrase \"Righteous coercion\") \nCoercion:\n1. The act or practice of coercing. \n2. Power or ability to coerce. \n3. The act or process of coercing. \n4. The application to another of either physical or moral force. When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced. When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact of submission under force. ‚ÄúCoactus volui‚Äù (I consented under compulsion) is the condition of mind which, when there is volition forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion.\n5. Actual or threatened force for the purpose of compelling action by another person; the act of coercing.\n6. Use of physical or moral force to compel a person to do something, or to abstain from doing something, thereby depriving that person of the exercise of free will.\n7. A specific instance of coercing.\n8. Conversion of a value of one data type to a value of another data type. \n9. Using force to cause something to occur. \n\nAs far as my moral understanding none of these definitions can be performed righteously. What I think you are refering to as coercion may very well be defined as just ownership or property rights. When one is said to \"own\" something that is to say they have authoritative control of the use, maintenance, and right to exchange. Your dominion is your property. (God's dominion is everthing and God is the Progenator) Within one's property rule enforcement is not coercion because those on your property have been invited and thus agree to those rules. One cannot agree to coercion. \n\nWhen it comes to government, the only way one might say you \"Agree to the rules\" of citizenship, is to be under the illusion that you chose the government. That IS an illusion. You may be complicit in the government's actions but you have not chosen anything. This lack of free will to choose IS coercion regardless of perceptions of divinity. The scriptures are inspired by God and written by men. In so doing, they are limited by man's understanding of societal structure and dominion. It could very well be that when a polity is made of wicked men, they make a wicked government. But it is not at all clear to me, that individuals working in their own endeavors freely and collaboratively exchanging their goods and services, need a governance structure outside of their moral adherence to God's will. There is no place for interference from the state even if it could somehow act righteously (again I am unsure how taking money without permission can be righteous given the commandment expressly forbidding it.) That claim to Righteous coercion IS the illusion to which I was referring. \n\nI hope that clarifies where I seem to diverge with your view point. Peace and love, Brother.",

Still, if my kids were to do something illegal in public or to someone from a different family, the local authorities would have dominion over justice.\n\nHowever, for justice (and many other things like education/moral formation) within my family, I can exclude a father from another family from intervening in our affairs or, more importantly, excluding the state from teaching things I disapprove of. So, in that sense, I have a monopoly in my position of authority in the family.\n\nThis nuance is articulated as subsidiarity in the Catholic tradition: the principle that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, with higher authorities intervening only when necessary. The concept goes back to at least the 13th century with St. Thomas Aquinas‚Äôs Summa Theologica, but Pope Pius XI used it specifically in his papal encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, which is an important document in the history of Catholic Social Teaching.",

He then deligates authority to lesser powers‚Äîto his heavenly host (like angels) as well as mankind. \n\nMan as God's image bearer is to take dominion of the earth‚Äîto cultivate, subdue, and rule (as God's governors). \n\nGod also subdivided his deligated authority to man into four primary forms of government‚Äîthe church, the magistrate (state), the family, and the individual. Each government has its own specific roles and boundaries‚Äîclergy do not declare war, the magistrate does not administer the sacraments, for example. \n\nWhen man sinned and fell, and all creation was subject to sin, man's governing roles and duties did not change but are now plagued with corruption. Even in a sinful world God did not do away with government. Rather, we are told that God gave the magistrate the sword to reward the just and to punish the unjust. \n\nIn 2 Samuel God says \"When one rules justly over man, ruling in the fear of God, he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass sprout from the earth\"\n\nIn proverbs 29:2, it says \"When the rightelus increase, the people flourish, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.\"\n\nUltimately we are all under the authority and rule of Christ, whether we accept that reality or not, but not accepting it as a peoples results in evil rulers. \n\nWe individually, as households, even as towns and communities and states, can and should resist evil rulers. Part of that resistance is writing code and using open protocols (nostr) and better money (bitcoin). But the heart of that resistance needs to be repentance and a return to rightly ordered rule under the ultimate lordship of Christ.",

    "content": "I've been thinking this through and I've encountered two closely related problems. My outline of the naive approach is: see the \"Vcash\" section of the Curve Trees paper. The \"pour\" algorithm already does most of what you want. You build a tree of utxo pubkeys, more exactly tags of the form G__nll =hash(pubkey)G_t to use the notation of the paper. Then for each of yours, you build the commitment as C_i = v_iG_v + G_nll_i + r_i H where v is the value of the coin and r_i is a random chosen by the prover to blind the commitment. So far so normal. Then you use CurveTrees' \"Selectandrerandomise\" algo to get C_rr,i (rr means 're-randomized' commitment) along with a proof of its validity (i.e. a proof that it's in the tree.\n\nAfter doing this for every one of your utxos, you then need to attach a second zero knowledge proof, a minor adaptation of \"pour\" in Fig 6 of the paper: instead of proving zero balance from summing ins and outs in a transaction, you prove \"commitment to my claimed balance minus the sum of commitments to the list I've given has value 0\". You also need to attach a range proof for each one of the outputs, but this is also handled by spend/pour in the paper.\n\nBut in that lies the problem: if I claim an exact amount, say 100 BTC, and I have to provide a list of N utxos, I've provided already too much information, in the general case: with a very specific amount and a number it's almost trivial (usually) to crunch the public utxo set and figure out the subset that gives the exactly correct total sum. I only see two directions to correct this problem. Use a proof of range instead of exact balance (prove x > y instead of x == y), but this can be surprisingly much more difficult than proving exact values in zero knowledge. Or, some form of aggregation to avoid leaking the number of items (so instead of one c_rr per one of your keys, somehow aggregating the selectandrerandomize? not sure if that actually even makes sense ...).\n\n\nnostr:nevent1qqs90g0yjyl3a4k28tqed65fpuynn06gu6566n2x4ndftwz33ft7w4cpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsrz0tl7",

To recap:\n\nyou want to prove that you own a total of T BTC, but privately. But revealing exact amount may make it too easy to deanon. So I have a proof of this statement: \"I own N utxos, whose total value is between k and k + 2^n, for some k and n that I announce, but I am not revealing which N utxos they are, or what their individual values is, out of a given list of 300k utxos\". The code at https://github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct/tree/auditing now does this.\n\nSee the latest commit note. In brief you need 3 or 4 components to the proof: 1/ a proof that each blinded commitment is part of that 300k set, 2/a proof that each committed value, when summed together, lies in the given range (using bulletproofs), and 3/ key images per utxo to ensure you dont' cheat by just claiming the same utxo multiple times.\n\nnostr:nevent1qqsqc8wgf8w74sh2sjfpjgw4lpp7sp08vfvgpc7dvljewn3cq4grscgpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsxpc8jd",

    "content": "NWS works with and without encrypted transport. There are lots of different flavors to explore. \n\nWhen used without encryption, the entry node must be run by the user themselves because public entry nodes would be able to listen in otherwise. Two options in those cases: run the entry node locally in tandem with your (unmodified) client, or skip the entry node and modify the client so that data is sent through nostr to the exit node directly (the client is the entry node).\n\nWhen used with encryption, the entry node can also be public. If the encryption doesn't rely on certificate authorities, it just works. You have to make sure you're talking to the right person, but that problem is as old as computer science. For example, ssh will ask you to confirm the fingerprint of the server when you connect.\n\nIf the encryption is https and the certificate was issued for a normal domain, your browser will complain (do you trust this website?) and the user will have to say \"let me pass, even if insecure\". Without ugly hacks (issuing your own root cert for example), I don't know ways to circumvent this. Note that Tor services doen't support https and they don't have to since transport is always Sphinx-encrypted (even hidden from the entry node).\n\nHow do you make sure you're talking to the right server if you use https? Couldn't the entry node just send your traffic somewhete else? We can actually do something that is unique to Nostr here: the exit node can publish its own TLS certificate on nostr and sign it. That's right, you don't need an authority to do that for you if you remain within the NWS system. Clients can fetch the cert from nostr before talking to the entry node and verify against that cert. \n\nHere is another cool part that we haven't talked about yet: the exit node can also be configured to reach the global Internet and not only a local service (we call this NWS v2). In those cases, NWS can be used a bit like a VPN. You can type \"https google dot com\" in your browser and your encrypted traffic would flow from your machine to the entry node, to the exit node, then to Google and back to you. on those cases, nobody complains about the certificate because everything is fine.\n\n\nExciting shit.

Do not delay.\n\n- Use a strong, high entropy passphrase to make bruteforcing the device credential impossible if secure element is ever exploited.\n\n- Set GrapheneOS auto reboot time accordingly so encrypted data goes back at rest when the phone reboots, which makes AFU exploitation impossible. The lower the better.\n\n- Enable duress password. Set it to something easy to trigger but not easy to misfire.\n\n- Turn your phone off in a high risk situation, and trigger duress when in a duress situation.\n\n- Disable your radios when not using them (turn off Wi-Fi, use airplane mode, disable NFC, UWB etc.) for attack surface reduction.\n\n- Set an appropriate USB port control or disable the USB port so they aren't able to connect a device to it.\n\n- Use user profiles (application data and user files within profiles are stored encrypted with separate credentials).\n\n- Enable upcoming GrapheneOS security features like second factor authentication unlock when they come out.\n\n- Communicate only over secure messaging. Some apps like Molly (Signal fork) have features to encrypt the app storage with a passphrase, which access to that app's data impossible even when a profile is compromised  providing the passphrase is secure enough.\n\n- Become disassociated to data. Learn to only keep files or other data as long as it is necessary. If you have no use for them for a long time, then back it up elsewhere, encrypted. Delete anything you don't have a use for in the present. Your data is not your memories. \n\n- Remember that you are only as secure as the people you trust.

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

With NWS, you can host any existing web application on Nostr without having to use DNS or even announce your public IP to the world, simply by sharing your service's npub (or nprofile).\n\nTry it out the demo yourself. Here is a Cashu test mint running with NWS. Let's use curl to retrieve the mint's information. The request travels from your computer to the public NWS entry relay, then through nostr to the service's NWS exit relay. At the other end is a Cashu mint with HTTPS encryption.\n\n```\ncurl -s -x socks5h://relay.8333.space:8882 https://nprofile1qqs8a8nk09fhrxylcd42haz8ev4cprhnk5egntvs0whafvaaxpk8plgpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuwpnxvejuumsv93k2g6k9kr/v1/info --insecure | jq\n```\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTMl.png \n\nI can't stress this enough: THE MINT RUNS BEHIND HTTPS!\n\nThe NWS entry relay can't read your traffic. It's encrypted. We can host public entry relays that can be used by anyone.\n\nThis means we can plug the entire internet to it üåê.\n\nLet's plug it into Cashu for now. Nutshell wallet supports socks5 proxies (that's how it uses Tor). By setting the public entry relay as the proxy, the wallet can now connect to a mint's npub/nprofile and communicate with it via NWS.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTot.png \n\nThis is going to be so freaking cool. And it's going to be a lot more useful than just for Cashu. There are still bugs and issues that need to be ironed out but the code is coming out soon. Watch this space.",

This was scattered in various places and I wanted to unify it, and also written several years ago and I'd forgotten how the protocol actually works!\n\nonion messages are *double* encrypted; this is the main source of confusion!  At the high layer, they're a series of nested encrypted calls (\"onionmsg_tlv\" in the BOLT 4 spec), so each recipient decrypts and hands it on: this is exactly the same as we use for payment information.  But inside that is *another* encrypted blob (onionmsg_tlv.encrypted_recipient_data), which requires a tweak which was handed to you alongside the onion, for you to decrypt (into an \"encrypted_data_tlv\").  Inside that is all the information about where to send next, any restrictions, and allows you to calculate the *next* tweak to hand on (it can also override the next tweak).\n\nThe double encryption is necessary because there are *three* actors here: Alice wants Bob to send her a message, without revealing her identity. So she gives Bob a \"blinded path\" which goes via Charlie: this path contains Charlie's pubkey (where to start the path), a blinding tweak, and two encrypted blobs for Alice to put into each layer of the onion message.  The first an encrypted blob which Charlie can read, which contains her pubkey so he knows where to send it next.  The second is her own, and contains a secret specific to the purpose of this message, so Bob can't play games trying to use this blinded path for anything else (\"hey, are you the same node as this previous payment?\") or use a different blinded path for this purpose.  She can also add dummy hops (we don't yet), which she will simply absorb, to obscure the path length from Bob.  You can add padding to make the hops indistinguishable (we don't yet).\n\nBob puts the actual stuff he wants to send Alice into the final onion call (often including his own blinded reply path!), along with the encrypted blob.\n\nImportantly, even if Bob were sending a message *not through a blinded path* he would use the same double-encrypted format: that's so Charlie can't tell whether a blinded path is being used or not, even though it's slightly less efficient.  Crypto is cheap these days, too.\n\nNow, if Alice gives Bob a blinded path to Charlie and Charlie is Bob's peer, he can simply send the onion and the first blinding tweak to Charlie.  But if Alice needs to send the message via Dave to Charlie, she needs to prepend a step.  That's not quite possible, naively, because blinding tweaks are generated *forwards*, and she needs Charlie to get the right blinding tweak from Dave, and Alice has no way of making that happen.  So inside Dave's encrypted blob, she uses next_blinding_override to tell Dave to hand that blinding override to Charlie instead of the normal one.  I just implemented this for Core Lightning (previously we would simply connect to the first node, which is privacy-compromising and should only be done as a last resort).\n\nThese blinded paths have some nice properties: you can't use part of them (you don't know the blinding factor except for the first one, so you can't start in the middle, and you can't replace any data), you need to use all of them.  They can contain timelimits to avoid easy probing, too: a classic measure would be to see if the path fails when a given node is down, but that takes time.  The spec insists all errors within the blinded path are the same, and originate from the entry: this loses some analytical power on failure, but makes probing harder.  The entry point is supposed to add a random delay (we don't yet!).  There may still be implementation differences, but they're hard for Bob to probe (and Alice doesn't need to, as she set up the path).\n",
