While I did not know it at the time, I knew in my heart of hearts that Bitcoin not only had a chance to save me from a life of mind-numbing pointless work, and nihilistic existence; but more than that, it allowed for me to believe in what I saw for myself, and my own understand of it before what everyone else was telling me. It let me stand up for myself against a world that just wanted to use me and keep me in the suppressed, small role it had relegated to me. Bitcoin allowed for me to decide something else against this system that could not see the light and love that I really am. \n\nThis decision came from my own strong conviction within myself that I knew from the deepest levels within me. Even though it seemed crazy, irrational, and like it wouldn‚Äôt work to everyone else; just like most major decisions that can change your life for the better, I knew it was what I had to do for myself. There are no other people who can make these kind of decisions for you, and that is why they are them in their lives and you are you in your life. Only you can make the decision for yourself about how your life is going to be, where you are going to put your energy and how you are going to save yourself against a world that wants to exploit you like a machine, and give you worthless paper in exchange for it.

However, Uber frequently anticipated this scheme and thwarted it. Uber used sophisticated software to identify the cartel‚Äôs enforcers and evade them. Uber altered the apps on the phones of the cartel‚Äôs would-be enforcers‚Äô so that drivers appeared to be unavailable, with their true locations hidden. Actual cars were replaced with non-existent ghost cars in these apps! Thus, the Uber ‚Äúunderground‚Äù rebels could conduct operations right under the regulators‚Äô noses yet still slip away. Sometimes the undercover taxi police would create false identities on a new cell phone number. Even then, Uber quickly adapted. They would deduce (or perhaps be informed, since satisfied Uber customers were turning up everywhere in the growing Uber underground) where the batch of phones had been purchased and eventually identify them. When cartel enforcers did manage to catch a driver. Uber would pay all fines and legal costs.\"\n\nObviously i have no way of verifying how true it is, but, wow.\n\nhttps://www.adamsmith.org/blog/uber-literally-saves-lives",

    "content": "Bull Bitcoin becomes the first mobile Bitcoin wallet that allows users to send and receive asynchronous Payjoin transactions without needing to run their own server, using BIP77!\n\nI am very excited about this new and bleeding-edge feature, because it has been a long-standing ambition of Bull Bitcoin to become the first Bitcoin exchange to process Bitcoin withdrawals via Payjoin (Pay-to-Endpoint) transactions.\n\nHowever, it was hard to justify Bull Bitcoin investing time into building this feature since there were no commercially available end-user Bitcoin wallets that were able to receive Payjoin payments. \n\nIndeed, in order to receive Payjoin payments (BIP78), a Bitcoin wallet needed to be connected to a full node server and be online at the moment the payment is made. This means in practice that only merchants, professional service providers and advanced full node users had the capacity to receive Payjoin payments. This is, we believe, one of the major reasons why Payjoin had failed to gain significant traction among Bitcoin users.\n\nFor this reason, the Payjoin V2 protocol (BIP77) was conceived and developed by Dan Gould, as part of the Payjoin Dev Kit project, to outsource the receiver's requirement to run his own server to an untrusted third-party server called the Payjoin Directory. In order to prevent the server from spying on users, the information is encrypted and relayed to the Payjoin Directory via an Oblivious HTTP server.\n\nBull Bitcoin‚Äôs Payjoin ambitions had been put on hold since 2020, until there was more adoption of Payjoin receiving capabilities among end-user Bitcoin wallets‚Ä¶ \n\nBut it turns out that in the meanwhile, Bull Bitcoin developed its own mobile Bitcoin wallet. And it also turns out that the open-source Bitcoin development firm Let There Be Lightning, which we had collaborated with in the past, had itself collaborated with Dan to build a software library for Payjoin that was compatible with and relatively straightforward to integrate into our own wallet software. All that was missing was to put the pieces together into a finished product. \n\nThanks to the collaborative open source effort of the Payjoin Dev Kit team, Let There Be Lightning team and the Bull Bitcoin team, the Bull Bitcoin wallet has now become the first commercially available end-user mobile wallet on the Google Play store to implement the BIP 77 Payjoin V2 protocol.\n\nMoreover, the Bull Bitcoin wallet has also implemented asynchronous Payjoin payments, which means that a Payjoin transaction can be ‚Äúpaused‚Äù until the receiver or the sender come back online. This way, the receiver's mobile phone can be ‚Äúturned off‚Äù when the sender makes the payment. As soon as the recipient‚Äôs phone is turned back on, the Payjoin session will resume and the recipient will receive the payment. This is a major breakthrough in the mobile Payjoin user experience.\n\nWe would like to thank the Human Rights Foundation for allocating a generous bounty for the development of a Serverless Payjoin protocol and its implementation in a mobile Bitcoin wallet, as well as OpenSats and Spiral for supporting the work of Payjoin Dev Kit, which made this all possible. \n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPayjoin, also known as Pay-to-endpoint, is a protocol which allows the Bitcoin wallet of a payments receiver and the Bitcoin wallet a payments sender to communicate with each other for the purpose of collaborating on creating a Bitcoin transaction. \n\nI first heard about Payjoin (then called Pay-to-endpoint) in 2018 and it completely blew my mind. What I liked most about it was that it was not a protocol change to Bitcoin, but rather it was an application-layer protocol that allows wallets to communicate in order to create smarter and more efficient Bitcoin transactions.\n\nWhereas in a normal Bitcoin payment the transaction is created by the sender, and all the inputs of that transaction belong to the sender, in a Payjoin payment both the sender and the receiver contribute coins as inputs.\n\nIn the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi wrote:\n\n\"some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner\"\n\nWith Payjoin, this assumption is no longer true. With Payjoin, we have fixed one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most fundamental privacy problems... without changing the Bitcoin protocol!\n\nIn a Payjoin transaction, the output amounts visible on the blockchain does not necessarily reflect the value of the payment that was actually exchanged. In other words, you can‚Äôt easily tell how much money one wallet sent to the other. This is great for users that are concerned a malicious third party may be attempting to obtain sensitive information about their finances without their consent. This does not however pose an accounting problem for the Bitcoin wallets involved in that transaction: since both wallets are aware of which coins they used as inputs and outputs, they are independently able to calculate the \"actual\" value of the payment that was sent even if the payment on the blockchain appears to be a of a different amount.\n\nPayjoin breaks the common input ownership heuristic, an assumption used by hackers and fraudsters to track ownership of addresses on the blockchain. The neat thing about this property of Payjoin is that it benefits everyone on the network, not just the Payjoin users themselves.\n\nIt allows the receiver of a payment to opportunistically consolidate his utxos when he is receiving funds, in a way which does not necessarily appear to be a consolidation transaction on the blockchain. Depending on the configuration of a payment transaction, it can also make a regular payment look like a consolidation.  \n\nIn addition to these benefits, the introduction of collaborative peer-to-peer transaction protocols opens up exciting opportunities for the creation of Lightning Network channels, as well as efficiencies for transaction batching. \n\nHow to use Payjoin in the Bull Bitcoin wallet:\n\nIt‚Äôs so seamless, you may not even realize you are using it!\n\nTo receive via Payjoin, simply navigate to the ‚ÄúReceive tab‚Äù using the network ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù and you will see a Payjoin invoice. When you want to get paid, send this invoice to the payer, or show them the QR code. If the sender‚Äôs wallet is compatible with Payjoin, it will be up to the sender to decide whether or not they want to use Payjoin. \n\nTo send via Payjoin, simply paste the receiver's Payjoin invoice, or scan the associated QR code, in the Bull Bitcoin wallet. If you decide that you don‚Äôt want to pay with Payjoin, simply turn off the Payjoin toggle. \n\nOriginal post: https://www.bullbitcoin.com/blog/bull-bitcoin-wallet-payjoin\n\nDownload the wallet: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bullbitcoin.mobile&hl=en-IN\n\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/NJWD.png\n",

Apps like Amber, nsec.app, and others have made it possible to manage your nostr keys in a way that is safer than browser extensions or pasting your nsec around the internet.\n\nBUT, none of them catered to teams. Groups like  nostr:npub1nstrcu63lzpjkz94djajuz2evrgu2psd66cwgc0gz0c0qazezx0q9urg5l and  nostr:npub19mduaf5569jx9xz555jcx3v06mvktvtpu0zgk47n4lcpjsz43zzqhj6vzk and many many companies out there are just sharing the main account nsec between different people and using it in different apps. A recipe for disaster. \n\nKeycast aims to finally fix this. It allows you to:\n\n- Manage teams of nostr users\n- Manage multiple keys that you want to give others access to\n- Create authorizations for those keys that grant specific permissions that can be changed, revoked, etc. \n- Create your own custom permissions\n- Run the signing infrastructure without any extra work\n\nAnd do it all in a self-sovereign way. Keycast is meant to be run on your server, by you. I think it's tremendously important that this sort of tool doesn't exist as a hosted service (which would basically be a huge key honeypot over time). \n\n The app is both a management web app AND a backend process that manages sub-processes that listen for remote signing requests, check permissions, and sign events.\n\nThere is a basic docker setup to start, but my goal is to have this easily deployable to StartOS, Umbrel, Podman, and others. \n\nCode here: https://github.com/erskingardner/keycast",

The large LCD and touchscreen eliminate the need for an external controller.\n\nThe control board and LCD are designed to be replaced, so you can safely share a SeedHammer II. A replacement kit is $89, comparable to the cost of a manual engraving kit.\n\nThe SeedHammer II OG limited edition is for you with the means to support the project. In return we will ship to you 1 of the 21 high-quality machines, and print your name or alias on every control board produced during the fundraiser.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/NCsc.mov\nhttps://m.primal.net/NCsi.jpg\nhttps://m.primal.net/NCsj.jpg\n",

    "content": "Years ago I remember Maxwell being very sniffy about the threshold ECDSA ideas that involved Paillier. There was a swathe of implementations in the last I guess, 6 years or so but, somehow I started reading some papers that were released since 2021 (links below) and realized .. it's kind of a shit show out there. The main protocols are the old Lindell one and GG18/GG20 ; they're using zk proofs and paillier to basically share keys for an ECDSA calculation. It is complex, and it doesn't \"flow\" as nicely as using one prime order group. An example: in one of the ZK proofs in GG18, you need to calculate a value t_1 = e * beta + gamma, where e is a typical fiat shamir hash, beta is the secret and gamma is a blinding factor. this looks very familiar right? (s = k + ex), but there's a vital detail: t_1 is *just an integer*, not an element of a finite field. Hence, even though e and beta might be values in a field of order N, let's say, then if you choose gamma to also be in that same 0..N-1 set, you've suddenly leaked the secret!\n\nWhy? Because e*beta is in the range 0..N^2, not 0..N. The way to exploit that is to just divide by e: t1/e = beta + gamma/e. And since gamma/e is less than 1 with probability 0.5, the right hand side is basically just beta!\n\nThis is one example, but others included improperly formed paillier public keys and absence of range proof checks, seen in implementations in the wild. Both Binance and Bitgo had the dubious privilege of being mentioned as having implementations that could leak the entire set of private keys in *one* signature - even covertly (i.e. the signing goes through). Not saying everything hasn't been fixed from these reports, but, sheesh.\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1234\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114\n\n#cryptography\n\n",

    "content": "# The Labor Theory of Value makes people idiotic\n\nSince forever, I've been fascinated by some seemingly inexplicable phenomena I encounter daily in Argentina‚Äîsomething that makes people prefer slow services over fast ones or trivial services over those that require expertise, study, or specialized knowledge.\n\nToday, I finally understood why, and I‚Äôd like to share it here. The Argentine is a socialist man. We may not be fully conscious of this, but it‚Äôs true. Just as someone who believes there is only one God and that Muhammad is His prophet is a Muslim, regardless of what they claim, we embrace socialist mantras, making us socialists‚Äîeven if we vehemently deny it.\n\nOne of the deepest beliefs ingrained in the Argentine belief system is that the value of something is determined by the amount of work required to produce it. This belief is so deeply rooted in our culture that it‚Äôs taken as common sense. It explains some self-defeating behavior and absurd decision-making.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example: Juan is a graphic designer with a week to complete an important project when his laptop suddenly stops working. In desperation, he takes it to Pedro, a computer repair technician with a solid reputation. Juan is stressed because this is his only laptop, he has no backup, and the deadline is looming. He anxiously asks Pedro how long it will take to fix the problem.\n\nPedro is an expert with extensive experience fixing laptops, especially that specific model. He immediately knows what the issue is and could resolve it in a matter of minutes. However, he tells Juan, ‚ÄúIt will take about a week.‚Äù\n\nBut why!? Why lie? Wouldn‚Äôt Pedro be seen as more efficient, knowledgeable, and even life-saving if he fixed Juan‚Äôs laptop on the spot? The answer: of course not! Remember that Juan doesn‚Äôt value Pedro‚Äôs service based on how quickly his need is met. Not at all. Juan‚Äôs need is irrelevant to Juan. What Juan values is the perceived amount of work Pedro has to do. If Pedro repairs the laptop in half an hour, the service would be perceived as worthless, and Pedro couldn't request more than a few pesos for it.\n\nPedro also believes in the labor theory of value. He feels he should be compensated not just for the time it takes to fix the laptop but for all the years of training and expertise that made the repair possible. Yet, Pedro knows that if he fixes the laptop on the spot, he couldn't charge what he thinks is fair because Juan would feel cheated and never return‚Äîor recommend him to others.\n\nThe result is a compromise where neither party is truly satisfied. Juan waits days for his laptop, and Pedro receives better payment than he would for a quick repair, but still less than he feels his expertise warrants.\n\n\nThe Argentine man is perfectly okay paying one hundred American dollars for a meal or forty dollars for a bottle of mediocre red wine. But paying forty or fifty dollars for a visit to the doctor? No way.\n\nYou could argue that a visit to the doctor might save your life in some cases, but those visits rarely last more than fifteen minutes. How could you justify paying more than what you pay for a bottle of wine that required tens of hours of hard work to produce?\n\n-----\n\nI wite about Argentine people but other Latin American peoples are even more retarded than us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Nostr!\n\nWe are Plan ‚Çø Network, and we‚Äôre absolutely thrilled to finally step into the purple space! Plan ‚Çø Network was born when two of the most passionate Bitcoiners on Earth decided to join forces to do what they love most: educating people about #Bitcoin. Basically they can‚Äôt get enough of babbling on and on about how Bitcoin is the greatest money ever invented, sprinkled with plenty of conspiracy theories for good measure. \n\nNaturally, the best way to ensure their message reached everyone was to create an open-source, centralized library of top-tier educational content and host a ton of classes along the way.\n\nAnd who are these two passionate Bitcoiners I keep talking about? None other than the legendary and inimitable  nostr:npub1r0gzy7ptcecpmjj3uv4kxychpqex3j52e8z9vyg3qy7jvcvyu2uq5tczhq and  nostr:npub1au23c73cpaq2whtazjf6cdrmvam6nkd4lg928nwmgl78374kn29sq9t53j. \n\nThe legend says they sat down at a lovely caf√© in Lugano, and together, they gave birth to this crazy institution we now call Plan ‚Çø Network. We‚Äôre not sure who was holding whose hand during the process, but one thing is for certain: with Rogzy‚Äôs creative genius and Giacomo‚Äôs irresistible Italian charm, the outcome was destined to be world-changing.\n\nThat‚Äôs us in a nutshell, a team of collaborators who are madly in love with Bitcoin and incredibly humbled to be part of this great orange-pilling mission. \n\nSo, what‚Äôs the coolest part about Plan ‚Çø Network?\n\nIt‚Äôs the simplicity: anyone can join. We welcome collaborators of all kinds. Educators, contributors, developers, translators, researchers, designers, organizers, maintainers, and, my personal favorite, dreamers. (Though I might be a bit biased because, well, I love being a dreamer.) \n\nCheck out our GitHub (https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content) to learn more about all the crazy ways collaborators make the magic of Plan ‚Çø come together, who knows maybe you want to join us too? \n\nAnd for this writer, who am I?

For instance, there‚Äôs  nostr:npub1t0g7qwh5hhypwvfa94hcv6f2eqmtme844r8y5gj8fem687eg9svs3ycd3n, our unstoppable Head of International Expansion, who spends his days traveling around the globe, setting up nodes to ensure Bitcoin education can continue long after we‚Äôre all gone. Then there‚Äôs  nostr:npub1ezaezjyuhnjqkj3unzhc6tqzdu5u7zgd0k4au6yrjvcftjx6gz8s9c8utn, our Chief Operations Officer also known as ‚ÄúThe Survivor of the Chaos‚Äù, the most patient person on our team, who helps bring order to the never ending amount of entropy Rogzy, Giacomo, and I tend to create.\n\nThese are just two examples of the amazing people who make up our ever-growing team. A team that is now beyond excited to be here, learning from all you nostriches. Together, we‚Äôre exploring ways to advance freedom and help others understand the magic that happens among all the relays, notes, and other stuff that keeps this space uncensored and alive.\n\nWe‚Äôd love to hear from you! Who should we interview? What should we do to ensure we‚Äôre learning and sharing the Nostr journey and its growth? Drop your recommendations, insights, or even a friendly ‚Äúhello.‚Äù Your input will help us continue our mission of sharing the process that makes this community free.\n\nThank you for welcoming us into the purple space.

    "content": "Vorwort zur ersten deutschen √úbersetzung des Souver√§nen Individuums:\n\nDas Buch erh√§ltlich auf: https://souver√§neindividuum.de\n\nIn der gro√üen Bilanz der menschlichen Literatur gibt es nur wenige B√ºcher, die die Zukunft akkurat voraussagen und uns den Weg mit ihrem hellen Licht der Weitsicht zeigen. \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" von James Dale Davidson und William Rees-Mogg ist ein solches Meisterwerk, ein vision√§res Buch, das nicht nur das Eintreten des digitalen Zeitalters vorausgesagt hat, sondern auch den intellektuellen Grundstein f√ºr die vollkommene Befreiung des Individuums von dem veralternden Nationstaates gelegt hat. Da wir nun ein paar Jahre nach dem Anfang der vorhergesagten neuen √Ñra stehen, ist es lohnenswert, dieses wegweisende Werk erneut zu betrachten und die vielf√§ltigen Weisen zu untersuchen, in denen seine Ideen verwirklicht wurden, insbesondere durch die ver√§ndernde Kraft von Cypherpunk Technologien. \n\nEin Gang durch die Seiten von \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ist eine Reise durch eine Landschaft der Ideen, die genauso gro√üartig ist wie vielf√§ltig. Die Autoren, beide bekannt f√ºr ihr Wissen in den Gebieten der Finanzen und √ñkonomie, spinnen eine √ºberzeugende Erz√§hlung, die historische Analyse, √∂konomische Theorie und technologisches Vorhersagen miteinander verbindet. Ihre kombinierten Fachkenntnisse erm√∂glichen es ihnen, das Bild einer Welt zu zeichnen, in der das Individuum sich erm√§chtigt. Ausgestattet mit den Werkzeugen der digitalen Technologie, k√∂nnen die Grenzen der Geographie, Kultur und Politik √ºberschritten werden, um ein beispielloses Freiheits- und Wohlstandsniveau zu erreichen. \n\nIm Zentrum von \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" steht die Idee, dass das Eintreten der digitalen Technologie die Machtbalance zwischen dem Einzelnen und dem Staat grundlegend ver√§ndert. Die Autoren argumentieren, dass das Informationszeitalter eine neue Klasse von Individuen geschaffen hat, die nicht den traditionellen Autorit√§tsquellen wie Regierungen und Gro√ükorporationen verpflichtet sind. Diese \"souver√§nen Individuen\" sind in der Lage, die Macht der digitalen Technologie zu nutzen, um Wohlstand zu schaffen, ihren Datenschutz zu gew√§hrleisten und die erstickende Bevormundung des Nationstaates zu entfliehen. \n\n\"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" prophezeite das Erscheinen von Digital-Nomaden: Einzelpersonen, die online arbeiten, w√§hrend sie um die Welt reisen und sich daf√ºr entscheiden, an jenen Orten zu wohnen, die ihnen die beste Umfeld bieten. In dieser globalisierten Welt k√∂nnen Staatsb√ºrgerschaft, Steuerresidenz, Firma-Jurisdiktion, Bankkonten und Investmentdepots aus verschiedenen L√§ndern bezogen werden, wodurch Einzelpersonen ihre Umst√§nde optimieren k√∂nnen, indem sie die besten verf√ºgbaren Optionen in jeder Gerichtsbarkeit ausw√§hlen. \n\nDie Implikationen dieser Vision sind tiefgreifend, da sie die Grundlagen unseres Verst√§ndnisses von Gesellschaft, Politik und √ñkonomie herausfordern. Indem sich \"das souver√§ne Individuum\" als ultimatives Machtzentrum positioniert, bricht der Einzelne mit traditionellen Hierarchien der Autorit√§t und begr√º√üt eine neue √Ñra des Individualismus und der Selbstbestimmung. Dies erfordert wiederum t iefgreifende Auswirkungen auf die Natur der Regierungsf√ºhrung, die Rolle des Staates und die Zukunft der Demokratie selbst. \n\nEines der auff√§lligsten Merkmale von \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ist seine weitsichtige Antizipation der ver√§ndernden Kraft der Cypherpunk-Technologie. Die Autoren geh√∂rten zu den ersten, die das Potenzial der digitalen Technologie erkannten, um eine neue Paradigma der individuellen Befreiung zu schaffen. Ihre Einsichten sind durch den bemerkenswerten Fortschritt der Cypherpunk-Bewegung in den vergangenen Jahren best√§tigt worden. Fast drei√üig Jahre nach der ersten Ausgabe, haben wir jetzt die M√∂glichkeit zu √ºberpr√ºfen, ob unsere heutigen Technologien auch den Prognosen entsprechen. \n\nDer Aufstieg von Bitcoin, der weltweit ersten dezentralen digitalen W√§hrung, ist vielleicht das eindrucksvollste Beispiel f√ºr die Verwirklichung der Vision der Autoren. Indem es die Macht der Kryptographie und des verteilten Konsensus nutzt, hat Bitcoin eine neue Form des Geldes geschaffen, die nicht den Launen der Zentralbanken oder den Unregelm√§√üigkeiten des globalen Finanzsystems unterliegt. Mit einer Bitcoin full node kann der Nutzer f√ºr sich selbst die Regeln seines eigenen Geldsystems definieren, verifizieren, und durchzusetzen, ganz ohne Vertrauen auf Institutionen oder Erlaubnis der Nationalstaaten. Dies hat seinerseits eine neue Klasse von Digital-Unternehmern hervorgebracht, die grenz√ºbergreifend transaktionsf√§hig sind, ohne auf das traditionellen FinanzsystemeI angewiesen zu sein. \n\nCoinjoin ist eine weitere Innovation, die die Privatsph√§re von Bitcoin-Transaktionen verbessert, w√§hrend das Lightning Network schnelle und kosteng√ºnstige Zahlungen bietet. Dank Bitcoin und Protokollen wie Cashu und Fedimint erlebt Ecash eine Renaissance. Cashu erm√∂glicht jedem ein digitales Geldlager zu betreiben, und beseitigt somit das Monopol von Depositbanken. Fedimint verbessert dieses Konzept, indem es Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten unter mehreren Betreibern in verschiedenen Jurisdiktionen verteilt. Diese Technologien zeigen, dass zus√§tzliche Protokolle die Souver√§nit√§t des Benutzers √ºber seine finanziellen Transaktionen im Bitcoin-Ekosystem exponentiell erh√∂hen k√∂nnen. \n\nDie Zero-Knowledge-Kryptographie ist ein weiterer Baustein f√ºr eine freiere Zukunft. Diese Technik erm√∂glicht es Einzelpersonen, Aussagen zu beweisen, ohne die konkreten Informationen preiszugeben. Damit k√∂nnen digitale Dienstleistungen zur Verf√ºgung gestellt werden, ohne dass der pers√∂nlichen Daten der Nutzer ver√∂ffentlicht werden. \nPeer-to-Peer-Systeme wie BitTorrent erm√∂glichen Benutzern direkten Austausch von Dateien und Ressourcen ohne Zwischenstellen, schaffen ein neues Paradigma der dezentralisierten Zusammenarbeit und Wissensaustausch. Zwiebelrouter wie Tor als auch Mixnets wie Nym erm√∂glichen verschl√ºsselte Kommunikation, bei der niemand wei√ü welcher Computer sich zu welchem anderen verbindet, erm√∂glichen freie Kommunikation ohne Angst vor √úberwachung oder Zensur. \n\nSchlie√ülich repr√§sentiert der Aufstieg von Nostr, einem neuen Protokoll f√ºr den standardisierten Austausch von signierten Daten, das neueste Gebiet des fortw√§hrenden Strebens nach digitaler Souver√§nit√§t. Nostr hat es geschafft, mit Alltagsapplikationen ein Web-of-Trust von kryptographischen Schl√ºsseln aufzubauen, welches ein fundentales Basis f√ºr die souver√§ne Zukunft ist. \n\nZusammenfassend ist \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ein bahnbrechendes Werk, das dem Test der Zeit standhalten konnte und eine Landkarte f√ºr das digitale Zeitalter bietet, die heute genauso relevant ist wie bei ihrer ersten Ver√∂ffentlichung. Ihre Autoren, James Dale Davidson und William Rees-Mogg, waren Vision√§re, die die ver√§ndernde Kraft der digitalen Technologie und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Zukunft des Einzelnen in der Gesellschaft vorhergesagt haben. Sowie wir weiterhin den unerbittlichen Marsch der Cypherpunk-Technologien verfolgen, erinnern wir uns an die dauerhafte Kraft der in diesen Seiten enthaltenen Ideen. In einer Welt, die zunehmend von dem Kampf zwischen individueller Freiheit und staatlicher Kontrolle gepr√§gt ist, bleibt \"Das Souver√§ne Individuum\" ein Ruf zu Taten, ein Zeugnis der unerbittlichen Geisteskraft der menschlichen Erfindungskraft und ein Leuchtturm der Hoffnung f√ºr die Zukunft der Menschheit.",

That means if your client does not support outbox, you're not likely to see our posts anymore.\n - I have disabled blastr on my haven relay (other users are still welcomed to use it of course)\n - I am now only using clients that fetch relays correctly, current daily driver is Gossip\n - heavy focus on improving UX for haven to get more users running it, including one click installation on umbrel/start9 and windows PCs.\n\nAlgorithm Relays\n\n - Many of us here have self selected for a chronological algorithm, but what about the 99% of users who try nostr and then leave? My theory is that platforms like twitter and tiktok are much better at retention because most people actually do prefer algorithms. And so with that, I will be prioritizing building the ultimate algorithm relay (WIP at  https://jouble.surge.sh/)\n - Make it easy for anyone to run any kind of algorithm they want, whether that is a good vibes algo, a rage bait algo, a viral algo, anything they want, and support a robust open market for users to choose from.\n\nContent Bots\n\n - Ensuring you don't have to leave nostr to get the information you want.\n - First iteration is mostly newsbots, but this will expand to many more types of content\n\nA lot more focus on building, a lot less focus on shitposting, and taking a more principled approach to nostr development.\n\nlove you nostr <3",

Until now, there has been no project like it.\n\nHowever, with all the wealth stored on hardware wallets (especially those that can only communicate over USB) it's important to have multiple implementations. Lark represents the first complete reimplementation of all common USB HWW clients in a language other than Python.\n\nEven though HWW manufacturers have used a dizzying array of different communication protocols and standards, Lark seeks to be identical to the HWI API, providing direct interchangeability and a more robust ecosystem.\n\nAll common commands are supported, and there is some additional functionality, such as retrieving a wallet registration from Ledger devices to avoid re-registration on every signing.\n\nLark is available as a command line application, and as a Java library for JVM-based applications. Hardware wallet manufacturers are invited to test their devices before it's integrated into Sparrow Wallet. \n\nSee https://github.com/sparrowwallet/larkapp for docs and binaries.\nhttps://m.primal.net/Mmkq.jpg",

    "content": "FICTION PERSPECTIVE: A Lodging of Wayfaring Men by Paul Rosenberg\n\nThough the book was written several years before the world knew of Satoshi Nakamoto, ‚ÄòWayfaring Men‚Äô has since become a legendary text for libertarians, freedom lovers, and bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nPaul Rosenberg has contributed to dozens of books and hundreds of blogs and articles in the freedom space. However, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Rosenberg has published many other fiction titles. Therein lies both the strength and weakness of the book: it is a powerful message delivered in the form of fiction, rather than rhetoric.\n\n‚ÄòWayfaring Men‚Äô is a tale of two brilliant men and their quest to open free markets via the Internet in the early 2000s. James Farber, economist, and Philipp Donson, deep thinker and philosopher, battle the FBI and NSA to bring freedom to the world via the ‚ÄòNew World‚Äô of the Internet.\n\nThe two men aim to spread a completely private and encrypted online free market contained within a computer game. This will result in a global network of markets able to operate in a system outside of government regulation and forced taxation.\n\nThis story was produced during the era of digi-cash, e-gold and Liberty Reserve, currencies and Internet markets that failed or were shut down. What makes it resonate so much with bitcoiners is that the success of Project Gamma (the free market in the book) rests upon unbreakable encryption and decentralization.\n\nThe most exciting portions of the book document the heroes‚Äô intelligent maneuvers and high-risk plots to throw the FBI off the scent. As the markets spread, the US and world governments employ more and more desperate means to stop the outflow of tax dollars and control of productivity. For example, Farber, Donson, and their teams of engineers have broken no laws, which leads the FBI to seek treason charges (in addition to spying on a host of law-abiding citizens).\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to put this book into a genre. It‚Äôs part thriller, part life story of the main characters, and part Utopian manifesto. The elements of the story include romance, religion, loss, and geopolitical change. Yet most of these are not fully developed or explored, rendering the story itself ‚Äòwayfaring‚Äô.\n\nThe villains of the piece are not entirely clear either. Two young FBI agents begin the hunt for those behind Gamma, dealing with the moral dilemmas of legality in different ways. The array of characters involved in the project seem crafted solely to deliver the project to its conclusion rather than giving the reader the ability to connect with their struggles and flaws. Perhaps the real hero is the concept of free trade.\n\nThe structure of the novel wanders too. The story sprawls across character backstories, years of progress on the project, truncated scenes, and unclear jumps in the time and location. Essays and opinion pieces which did not fit into the story are adjoined in a pair of appendices.\n\nIf you are a fan of flowing descriptions, deep character explorations, and literary craft, this is not the novel for you. Wayfaring Men delivers clear and functional prose to meet its lofty ambition ‚Äî outlining our path to freedom.\n\nBut for all its faults, you keep reading. You root for the protagonists to succeed because you want the same thing as they do. Essentially, packaging this idea as fiction opens up a whole new audience ‚Äî those who neglect reading heavy non-fiction manifestos.\n\nOverall, I would describe this as a poor novel, but a powerful book. I found myself recommending it to a fellow freedom enthusiast straight after reading it. Those who are wired to more functional and utilitarian thinking will appreciate the story of how we wrestled freedom from the jaws of enslavement.\n\nPhilip Charter, Editor.\n\n\np.s. Thanks to nostr:npub1klkk3vrzme455yh9rl2jshq7rc8dpegj3ndf82c3ks2sk40dxt7qulx3vt for the recommendation.\n\ncheck out his recent audiobook recording of Wayfaring Men if you please.\n\n\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Mlie.jpg\n",

    "content": "Yeah, I guessed you might be talking about FHE and similar stuff. But I wonder if the most basic concept still fits your description: just blind your witness and send that to the server. Then the server does the ZKP, so to speak \"encrypted\". This would only work directly for the simplest structures. Like a \"reverse blinded signature\" is the easiest one I could think of. Instead of blinding the message that the signer signs, you blind what key is being used to sign the (public) message.  A signature is technically a ZKP (a zk-proof of knowledge). I have x, I give the server b+x, they sign with that: s' = k + e(b+x), I subtract eb to get s = k + ex. Notice that this is a weakness (arguably a fatal weakness) of non key-prefixed schnorr; it only works if you hash H(R,m) not H(P,R,m).",

    "content": "I‚Äôm back with another essay from The Cypherpunk‚Äôs Bible. \n\nA Lodging of Wayfaring Men by Paul Rosenberg. \n\nIf you haven‚Äôt read this book I encourage you to. Recently nostr:npub1klkk3vrzme455yh9rl2jshq7rc8dpegj3ndf82c3ks2sk40dxt7qulx3vt recorded the audio version which you can find here on Paul‚Äôs website. \n\nhttps://freemansperspective.com/audiobook-a-lodging-of-wayfaring-men/\n_____________________________ \n\nFarber‚Äôs Second Essay\n\nHistory books tell the stories of rulers. Some are kings, some emperors, some presidents or prime ministers, and some bear more exotic titles. A few of them were more or less benevolent, and others were tyrants. Most were in between, but they all held one thing in common: they maintained a monopoly on the use of force in their territories. They reserved the right to use coercion and prevented all others from doing so. \n\nStripped of romantic rhetoric and patriotic emotion, the essence of rulership is the ability to maintain a monopoly of force. Argue if you like, but you will be arguing with the dictionary. Every reform of government and rulership to date has kept the central mechanism of coercion in place. Did some governmental reforms lead to improvements? Certainly, they made things considerably less bad. But they left centralized coercion in place, and for every good leader that has come along, such as a Washington or a Churchill, we‚Äôve had several times as many Stalins or Maos.\n\nI have friends who study such things, and they assure me that roughly 2% of all people would be dictators if they had the opportunity. If they could oppress the world, they would. Another 12% or so are would-be facilitators‚Äîthat is, when one of the 2% rises to power, these people are glad to fill a slot and vigorously exercise power over others. Like it or not, these people are out there, and they are drawn to the levers of power. Once in a while, they have their turn. When they do, innocent people die in large numbers. Over 100 million died this way in the past century. Try to comprehend that: 100 √ó 1,000 √ó 1,000 people. Boys, girls, men, women, teenagers‚Äîshort, tall, strong, weak, dark-skinned, and light-skinned‚Äîall of them dead because twisted people were able to take hold of centralized force.\n\nIf you‚Äôve wondered why some of us are so determined to keep governments out of cyberspace, please understand that this is why. We‚Äôve had enough of centralized force. We are removing the whole mechanism. We think it was a mistake from the beginning. We don‚Äôt want there to be anything for the 2% to grab. \n\nIf you want coercive rulership, keep it. We won‚Äôt try to take it away from you, but we have chosen to opt out. Don‚Äôt try to reign us back in. We won‚Äôt try to make you live our way, and you don‚Äôt try to make us live your way. We are not your property. \n\nOur arrangement has no central mechanism of coercion, and it has been working quite well for several years now. We like it. This new arrangement has, however, surprised us in several ways. One of the things we discovered was that once you remove the mechanisms of coercion, you remove something else: politics. Politics is the art and science of managing centralized coercion. This is the reason political debates are so infuriating. The final decision leads to an opposable force. Once the political process is completed, you have the choice either to obey or to be punished. \n\nCoercion is the sine qua non of politics‚Äîthe thing without which politics would not be politics. Indeed, if you remove coercion, politics becomes something else: economics. \n\nThings work here by economic means. If you don‚Äôt like the way a market operates, just move to a different one. Or, if no one does it the way you think is right, start your own. There are no protected services here and nothing mandatory. You may opt out of anything you don‚Äôt like or offer any service you like. We couldn‚Äôt stop you if you wanted to start a communist collective. The only limitation would be that you could not force anyone to join or remain part of your collective. We have no mechanism for that. The entire system is built around the idea that persuading people to trade with you is moral and that forcing them is not.\n\nWe think our ideas are right, but we will not impose them on you. You can hold whatever ideas you like; just don‚Äôt impose them on us. \n\nAll this being said, what really concerns your rulers‚Äîand what is driving them to demonize us‚Äîis that people are leaving their systems and joining ours. Your children are enjoying the private digital economy in huge numbers. \n\nNo, the young people are not joining us for historical and philosophical reasons. Those things are mostly for us older people. Young people, as always, are looking for adventure and opportunity. In your regulated world, very few people ever get much real adventure or overwhelming success. They read about such things in novels and celebrity tabloids; they see them in movies, but very few actually experience such things. Our world, on the other hand, has adventure and opportunity in wholesale quantities. Your children may have to work hard to get it, but a big life is waiting for them if they wish to earn it.\n\nIn our world, intelligence, daring, and perseverance are rewarded far more directly than in your regulated world. Here, you can be a complete unknown with no connections and no wealth. But if you can learn to provide excellent ideas or services, you can get rich. No one here knows or cares about the color of your skin, your sex, who you sleep with, or anything of the sort. If you can produce, you‚Äôre a player. Want to go from rags to riches? Pick a valuable skill in our world, throw yourself into it with all your might, excel at it, and start selling it. Effort is all you need. You don‚Äôt need friends in the right places, only value to offer.\n\nAnd there‚Äôs more. The truth is that the best rewards come to those who are first at something new. Jobs and Wozniak were the first to produce a good personal computer, but other people would‚Äôve done the same thing within a year or two. They got to do all the cool stuff only because they were first. You can say the same thing for every other discovery or invention. Human knowledge is built piece upon piece, and new discoveries follow more or less in that sequence. If you want to do the really fun things, you have to get to the front of the line. \n\nThe stream of human knowledge is now firmly rooted in our world. The frontier of Alvin Toffler‚Äôs third wave is in cyberspace, and that‚Äôs where the front of the line can be found.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the future of the third wave: The central ideal of your old world is coercive authority. This is embodied not only in rulership but in schools, families, religions, and most every area of life. We were all born into a world that told us, ‚ÄúDo what you‚Äôre told, or we‚Äôll hurt you.‚Äù Our parents told us that. Our teachers imposed it on us. Our gods were envisioned this way. And certainly, the rulers of the Earth operate this way. From birth to death, continually, it confronts you all.\n\nHaving lived with these ideas for a 100 generations, humanity is used to this and can survive it moderately well. But it is far from ideal.\n\nFrom birth on, you were trained to obey or else‚Äîto worry that you might do something wrong without realizing it. It puts you in a sort of perpetual cringe, unconsciously cowering in expectation of the next blow. Being used to it is no reason to think it isn‚Äôt damaging. \n\nWe have eliminated this. It has no root here, no mechanism. This is having an effect on the world already, although it certainly has a long way to go. But it is here, and it is not fading away. It may be a generation or two before we begin to see how the coercion-free mind works, longer before it becomes dominant. Nonetheless, the seeds have been planted, and they are thriving.\n\nWe certainly didn‚Äôt start this. Its roots trace back to every free thinker, to every rebel for truth, to the true heroes who, in a thousand areas of life, had the courage to be right even in the face of opposition. We are simply carrying on their work at the moment when it threatens to reach critical mass. If we were simply one more reform movement, we would seek to conquer your system and run it our way. That, however, is not what we are. We do not accept coercion as moral. We do not wish to coerce anyone, and we will not submit to being forced. We do not want to run your system.\n\nIf all of this seems threatening to you, I‚Äôm sorry. I know how that can feel. We are not your enemies. We are your friends. We are also your future. We will not harm you. We do not want to take your government away from you. We do not want to control your government. We are not asking you to change your lives. We are only withdrawing from your game. Go your own way in peace. We wish you well. We still love you. We still care about you. We‚Äôll still spend time with you, and in the right situation, we would still defend you. But we will not remain part of your coercive systems.\n\nWe are pleased to share this planet with you, but we do not wish to share your social structures. We want to do a new thing, a better thing. If you wish the best for your children, encourage them to step into a new world‚Äîa world where they can own their own lives and enjoy the fruits of their own labor. A perfect world? No, but a much better world than the one with centralized coercion and obedience to authority as its main pillars. \n\nWe do wish you well.\n\nJames Farber",

    "content": "Android 15 QPR2 is moving 6th/7th/8th generation Pixels to the Linux kernel's 6.1 LTS branch already used for 9th generation Pixels. This will reduce the kernel branches we need to support down to 6.1 and 6.6. There will likely need to be a yearly migration for all the devices.\n\nLinux kernel increased official support time for the Long Term Support (LTS) branches from 2 years to 6 years, mainly for Android devices using Generic Kernel Image (GKI) releases. However, it was recently reduced back to 2 years. Pixels will need to start migrating every year.\n\nIt will likely take around 6 months for a new branch to be considered stable enough with most regressions resolved and another 6 months to successfully integrate and ship it. Therefore, 2 years of support implies yearly migrations to keep up rather than doing it every 2 years.\n\nUpstream LTS releases are closely connected to Android. Moving to 6 years of support was likely closely connected to the Pixel 6 moving to 5 years of support. GKI made the drivers far more standalone and easy to migrate, and Linux moving back to 2 year support is likely related.\n\nGoogle has been testing newer kernels with the Pixel 6 and later for years. They have 6.6 and newer mainline kernels working fine already, it just takes a long time until the kernels are stable enough to consider shipping them. It's great that it's finally going to be happening.\n\nNewer kernels bring many new features and increasingly complexity which means they bring lots of new security bugs. Older kernels get an increasingly small subset of bug fixes including security fixes backported in the LTS releases. Newer kernels also bring new security features.\n\nUsing a year old kernel for around a year and then upgrading to a new year old kernel is likely the best balance that's available. With 2 year support time, they can focus on backporting more patches and providing more testing/stability since there will be far fewer LTS branches.\n\nIt's not commonly understood that Android itself only has a single LTS branch, which is current Android 15. It receives monthly and quarterly updates. It moves to a new LTS with a yearly update after it has gone through many months of public testing via Developer Preview / Beta.\n\nMany people including journalists covering it in tech news media wrongly believe Android's monthly security patch releases are the monthly releases. No, the monthly security patches are backports of a subset of the privacy/security patches to older releases. They're incomplete.\n\nAndroid's monthly releases have many changes beyond privacy/security patches even when it's not a quarterly or yearly release. They also have a lot more privacy/security patches than the Android Security Bulletin backports. They backport High/Critical severity patches, not all.\n\nThese updates are a major factor in why Pixels are the only Android devices with competitive security with iPhones. Pixels also have a lot of hardware security features not implemented on other Android devices. They also have higher quality of implementation across the board.\n\nGoogle will likely require other OEMs start upgrading kernel branches. However, standards for other OEMs are always far lower than the standards met by Pixels. For example, many important hardware security features are recommended in the CDD, not mandatory, or not even listed.\n\nWe aren't aware of any OEM trying to keep up with the monthly releases, only OEMs skipping all the monthly/quarterly releases but trying to ship the yearly release around the official launch. Only Samsung tries to keep up with the new security features, but lags quite behind.\n\nOther Android OEMs do the bare minimum required by Google unless their SoC vendor (generally Qualcomm) hands the feature to them on a silver platter with no additional cost. They largely ship the monthly security backports now, but with significant delays or skipping some months.\n\nThe reduction of support time for Linux kernel LTS releases from 6 years to 2 years is likely going to become a major problem for non-Pixel Android devices. Google will likely require them to upgrade but probably at a very delayed schedule where they fall out of support first.\n\nOur official hardware requirements are listed here:\n\nhttps://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices\n\nYou can see support for Linux 6.1 or 6.6 is already a requirement for new devices. We'll be adding a requirement to upgrade the kernel branch because it will be essential with 2 year Linux LTS support.\n\n#GrapheneOS",

He argues that this system is the key to human progress and that it is being stifled by governments and bureaucracies that seek to control and regulate human activity. Farber advocates for human freedom and creativity, and suggests that the only place where this can truly be achieved is in \" #cyberspace .\"\n\nKey Points:\n\nI. The Positive-Sum Game\n\n* Refers to a system where human #energy and creativity are allowed to flourish\n* Leads to the creation of wealth and innovation\n* Is the key to human #progress\n\nII. History of the Positive-Sum Game\n\n* Originated in the merchant class of Venice\n* Flourished in America and other parts of the world\n* Is based on the idea that human energy is the driving force behind #creativity and #innovation\n\nIII. The Zero-Sum Game\n\n* Based on the idea that there is only a fixed amount of #wealth and resources available\n* One person's gain must come at the expense of another\n* Is a false idea used to justify control and regulation\n\nIV. Government Intervention\n\n* Stifles the positive-sum game by imposing regulations and taxes\n* Limits human creativity and innovation\n* Is often justified by the idea of \"helping the poor,\" but ultimately leads to a life of dependency and stagnation\n\nV. Cyberspace as a Solution\n\n* Is the only place where humans can truly be free to pursue their own interests and passions\n* Allows for the creation of a new space for human freedom and creativity\n* Is necessary for the survival and flourishing of the positive-sum game\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\n* Human #freedom and #creativity are essential for human progress\n* Governments and bureaucracies often stifle these values\n* #Cyberspace offers a new opportunity for human freedom and creativity to flourish.",

    "content": "FARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY \n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn‚Äôt know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families. \nIt began to break out when the deep superstition of the middle ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far -off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over a hundred years. \nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the great discovery of the modern era: the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It is the operation of creation, using the only counter entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab, to the front office, to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service, and it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skill overcomes a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud, and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do ‚Äì to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion ‚Äì it cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world; within several decades their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their Kings, seeking permissions from their rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and braking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild; as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the middle ages, and not much else. Do you think the people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not! You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äì human energy ‚Äì creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves are of little worth, and when you add human creativity you can create vehicles, computers, and space ships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of the earth, if they could have turned into something great of themselves they would have done it long ago. But they cannot ‚Äì it is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of materials becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey who do not play the positive-sum game instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚Äì the idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks of ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth,‚Äô but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experiment of communism has taught the world‚Äôs rulers that the positive-sum game is necessary. So, their plan now is to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it all together. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world upon our backs. Are they worth half of our efforts ‚Äì half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees and regulations ‚Äì for what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor,‚Äù they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you that this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so ‚Äì even to consider it.\n\nAnd are the poor better off? Certainly some of our money goes to the poor (although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy). This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp, and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you. \nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat phrases like, ‚Äúthat is the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason, and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them ‚Äì you are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half-speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s. Then, slowly, the curbs and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had been, as one writer said, ‚Äògeared for giants.‚Äô But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive-sum game ‚Äì only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half -speed, yet its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum gave during my lifetime ‚Äì Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the east in one generation ‚Äì an explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and stillborn! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats world-wide. Where will we go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled, or will it migrate to new and open lands?\n\nBut! Moving to a new land will be a problem, won‚Äôt it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So, until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found ‚Äì cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will ‚Äì and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants ‚Äì establish the positive-sum game without restriction. \n\nToward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it, and we‚Äôve broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now, the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment, and see if freedom really is better than ser vitude. Why won‚Äôt they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind, or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want is to be left alone and to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us? \n ~ James Farber ",

  {
    "content": "FARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY \n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn‚Äôt know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families. \nIt began to break out when the deep superstition of the middle ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far -off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over a hundred years. \nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the great discovery of the modern era: the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It is the operation of creation, using the only counter entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab, to the front office, to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service, and it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skill overcomes a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud, and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do ‚Äì to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion ‚Äì it cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world; within several decades their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their Kings, seeking permissions from their rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and braking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild; as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the middle ages, and not much else. Do you think the people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not! You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äì human energy ‚Äì creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves are of little worth, and when you add human creativity you can create vehicles, computers, and space ships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of the earth, if they could have turned into something great of themselves they would have done it long ago. But they cannot ‚Äì it is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of materials becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey who do not play the positive-sum game instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚Äì the idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks of ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth,‚Äô but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experiment of communism has taught the world‚Äôs rulers that the positive-sum game is necessary. So, their plan now is to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it all together. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world upon our backs. Are they worth half of our efforts ‚Äì half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees and regulations ‚Äì for what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor,‚Äù they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you that this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so ‚Äì even to consider it.\n\nAnd are the poor better off? Certainly some of our money goes to the poor (although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy). This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp, and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you. \nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat phrases like, ‚Äúthat is the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason, and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them ‚Äì you are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half-speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s. Then, slowly, the curbs and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had been, as one writer said, ‚Äògeared for giants.‚Äô But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive-sum game ‚Äì only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half -speed, yet its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum gave during my lifetime ‚Äì Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the east in one generation ‚Äì an explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and stillborn! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats world-wide. Where will we go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled, or will it migrate to new and open lands?\n\nBut! Moving to a new land will be a problem, won‚Äôt it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So, until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found ‚Äì cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will ‚Äì and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants ‚Äì establish the positive-sum game without restriction. \n\nToward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it, and we‚Äôve broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now, the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment, and see if freedom really is better than ser vitude. Why won‚Äôt they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind, or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want is to be left alone and to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us? \n ~ James Farber ",

Here's how it works:\n\nAdd and upvote tracks in the queue ‚ûï\n\nSearch for any song on Fountain and pay 100 sats to add it to the queue.. Upvote any track in the queue to change its position. 1 sat equals 1 upvote and the track with the most upvotes will play next.\n\nSupport the artist currently playing ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nBoost to send a payment with a message on enable streaming to send a small amount for every minute you spend listening. 95% of every boost and streaming payment goes directly to the artist currently playing.\n\nPost in the live chat üí¨\n\nHang out with other listeners in the live chat by connecting Nostr. You can post chat messages for free. Every time a track is added or upvoted this appears in the activity feed too.\n\nSave tracks to your library üíú\n\nListen to your latest discoveries again later in the app. Tap on any content card to add a song to your library or a playlist, or see more music from that artist.\n\nListen to Fountain Radio on other apps üéß\n\nFountain Radio now has its own RSS feed so you can tune in on any podcast app that supports live streams and Nostr live streaming platforms like  nostr:npub1eaz6dwsnvwkha5sn5puwwyxjgy26uusundrm684lg3vw4ma5c2jsqarcgz.\n\nArtist takeovers üîí\n\nArtists can now take control of the music and host a listening party. During a takeover, only the host can add tracks to the queue and upvotes are disabled.\n\nThe first artist takeover will be with  nostr:npub19r9qrxmckj2vyk5a5ttyt966s5qu06vmzyczuh97wj8wtyluktxqymeukr on Wednesday 27th November at 12:00pm EST.

    "content": "Over the past few weeks, we have been learning and testing the MLS protocol and have gained a deeper understanding of it. Below is a note providing a general description of the MLS protocol.\n\nThe MLS group members (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) form the leaf nodes of a binary tree as shown below. Each member has a pair of public and private keys.\n\nFor member A, they use their private key Ôøº and member B‚Äôs public key Ôøº to perform an ECDH computation. For member B, they use their private key Ôøº and member A‚Äôs public key Ôøº to perform an ECDH computation. \n\nBoth compute the same value. This value becomes the private key of Node3, and from this, the public key of Node3 can also be derived.\n\nSimilarly, other members perform their respective ECDH computations.\n\nMoreover, nodes higher in the tree also perform their respective ECDH computations up to the Root. Node3 and Node4 compute the private key of Node1 through ECDH, while Node5 and Node6 compute the private key of Node2. Node1 and Node2 compute the private key of the Root through ECDH.\n\nThe private key of the Root is the shared key among the MLS group members. Each member uses this shared key along with their respective related keys to derive their message encryption key.\n\nThe most important feature of this key tree is that child nodes know the private keys of their parent nodes.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nIf member A suspects their key has been compromised, they need to update their key.\n\nMember A generates a new key pair Ôøº (public key and private key) locally and recalculates the keys for Node3‚Äô, Node1‚Äô, and Root‚Äô.\n\nThen, A encrypts the public keys of Node3‚Äô and Node1‚Äô using the old public keys of Node3 and Node1, respectively, and sends them to all group members.\n\nWhen member H receives and decrypts the message, they obtain the public key of Node1‚Äô and, combined with the private key of Node2, perform an ECDH computation to calculate the new private key of Root‚Äô.\n\nOther members perform similar operations. As a result, all members successfully update the key tree.\n\nThe advantage of the MLS protocol is that when a member updates their key, the complexity of updating the key tree is reduced to ÔøºO(logN).\n\nImagine if there were no binary tree. When A updates their key, they would need to update the message one-to-one for each group member, resulting in a complexity of ÔøºO(N).\n\nHowever, if member B‚Äôs key is compromised, member A updating their key cannot rescue member B. Each member‚Äôs update key operation can only protect themselves, not all members. https://image.nostr.build/10752c810a9aef73885173ecb7b76f9e65ce322c2c2edefdda7a82dd4b58d7a4.jpg https://image.nostr.build/80864aad3cb9a3e8ecd91cd0de77c10cd5ba9d54dbe182c9631825ab0482069b.jpg  nostr:note1guzracdd3rfyussrfxjt63h3seela9a0jyzx5hd7gjmzhxsx7efs57mq8y",

    "content": "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death\n ~ Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775\n\nNo man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\n\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\n\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free ‚Äî if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending ‚Äî if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained ‚Äî we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\n\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable ‚Äî and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.\n\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace ‚Äî but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n",

The results available from the charts are the same as our expectations made from our insights with other forensic company activities and people who inform us of their capabilities. We also are seeing a domino effect of further publications of leaked capabilities from forensic firms after our publication of the April and July 2024 Cellebrite device support matrix.\n\nFrom what you can see in the GrayKey documentation, our previous disclosure of vulnerabilities affecting Stock OS Pixel devices that were exploited by forensics firms such as MSAB in the start of the year have disrupted their capabilities. We reported those exploits to Google in January 2024 with multiple proposals on how to stop it. In April 2024, the first two patches for these vulnerabilities were shipped and we can see that since April 2024 the extraction capability for GrayKey on all Pixel devices they supported were downgraded.\n\nhttps://image.nostr.build/78f47da06d2601e616360cb8745e2bff09f8507766237db79f44cdc4c1ff00b2.jpg\n\nWe have a good idea of what was happening based on the detailed info we obtained about MSAB's XRY exploit tool. XRY was exploiting littlekernel-based fastboot mode firmware used on Pixels via USB. Many other devices also use littlekernel for this, or the higher attack surface EDK2. CVE-2024-29745 is the identifier for the reset attack vulnerability we reported for the fastboot mode. Google addressed this in April 2024 by implementing our proposal of zeroing memory on boot. Graykey was downgraded from Full access to Partial access in April 2024 and has stayed that way since.\n\nCellebrite Premium is clearly exploiting the stock Pixel OS via USB rather than using this approach. Therefore, Cellebrite didn't lose any capabilities on the Stock OS because of the improvement - however they lost brute force capability. Our exploit protections have been successfully blocking Cellebrite even before major improvements in 2024 and GrapheneOS is still unaffected by their tools.\n\nThe device's data is divided in 2 parts: The vast majority of data is Credential Encrypted (CE) per-profile and a small portion of OS data is Device Encrypted (DE). DE data is available to the OS Before First Unlock (BFU). Exploiting fastboot mode will only give DE data since April 2024. One of our planned features is a boot authentication toggle to request the Owner lock method in early boot. This will protect the small amount of DE data such as installed packages and saved Wi-Fi networks from firmware/hardware exploits. However, it's not sensitive user data.\n\nPartial access means limited access to operating system metadata and the Device Encrypted data and we are not concerned over such a limited data scope.\n\nCellebrite's approach of exploiting the OS itself is more difficult but they avoided having nearly all their capabilities wiped out by the reset attack mitigation we successfully got Pixels to implement. Other Android devices haven't implemented reset attack mitigation though. The way Google implemented it only covers fastboot mode. We wanted them to cover the OS boot modes too but they haven't shipped it yet. Our zero-on-free feature addresses it for OS reboot/shutdown and we plan to add zero on boot too until we convince them to add it in firmware.\n\nCellebrite's approach involves attacking the OS itself so all of our generic memory corruption exploit protections and other defenses are there to stop it. We also nearly fully wiped out the USB attack vector for the OS with our 2024 overhaul of our USB attack surface reduction. By default, #GrapheneOS disables new USB-C connections as soon as the device is locked at both a hardware and software level. It then fully disables USB-C data at a hardware level once existing connections end or right away if there weren't any. They'd need another attack vector. \n\nFor example, they could still target GrapheneOS via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular. However, getting into the device from any of those will still be much harder than with the stock OS, and it's more complex than USB in general. There's a reason they have always preferred USB. USB is preferred because it provides little tampering with the OS and maintains forensic soundness. \n\nAt this current point in time Cellebrite is certainly the industry leader when it comes to Pixel research. Their research teams follow the same trends and innovations and want to research attacks for #security technologies we desire or have inherited on our platforms when they have become available, such as MTE and PAC. A GrapheneOS extraction capability of any kind is high-demand for any company in the forensics industry and they appear dedicated to want to be first which makes sense as they are certainly the largest. We will continue providing commensurate response to any new threats.\n\nSince 2021, we've had an auto-reboot timer feature which reboots the device after it's locked if it isn't unlocked before the timer expires. iOS recently added this with a hard-wired 72 hour timer. Our default is 18 hours but users can configure it from 10 minutes to 72 hours. If you need maximum protection, using the 10 minute auto-reboot would be ideal. There's also the option to fully disabling USB-C while OS is booted by also disabling charging including USB-PD. You can also enable turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth via timers, which we plan to extend to NFC. You should also get any of the 4 currently available 9th gen Pixels to use GrapheneOS. They have more cellular radio hardening and GrapheneOS-specific kernel hardening implemented right now, but 8th gen is likely going to upgrade to the same 6.1 kernel branch soon.\n\nWe strongly recommend 8th/9th gen Pixels for greatly improved security on GrapheneOS via hardware memory tagging. It's enabled for the base OS including apps by default and opt-in for user installed apps, whcih we recommend, and then opt-out per app for apps with bugs it catches.",

The CEP deals with individual parties only.\n5. Agreements must be communicated openly and clearly.\n6. Individuals/parties should keep their agreements.\n7. Individuals/parties should not aggress against, encroach upon, or defraud others.\n8. Private property is to be respected and protected.\n9. Self-induced harms are the sole responsibility of the individual or party in question.\n10. All the effects of an action must be taken into account.\n11. Restitution is preferred above punishment.\n12. Violence is a very costly means of solving disputes and is to be avoided.\n12. Mistakes and emergency actions are part of human life, but must be repaired.\n13. The CEP does not require omniscience of anyone.\n14. The purposes of judgments are to secure free and functional markets and to recompense injured parties.\n‚Äã15. The standard for the application of the CEP is the reasonable man.",

    "content": "This essay in Paul Rosenberg‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA Lodging of Wayfaring Men‚Äù has never been more important than it is today. \n\nFARBER‚ÄôS FIRST ESSAY\n\nIt began with rogue traders and the merchants of Venice. They really didn't know what they were building or how it would work. They merely struggled for the betterment of themselves and their families.\n\n It began to break out when the deep superstition of the Middle Ages cracked open under the strain of new philosophies and religious ideas.\n\nIt found room to thrive wherever new and wild vistas were found. It expanded with each discovery of far-off new lands. It made its home everywhere the old order was broken up and fresh starts were being made. It took a firm root in America and flourished there for over 100 years.\n\nNever again, where history is recorded, will there be any question as to whether or not it works.\n\n‚ÄúIt,‚Äù is the greatest discovery of the modern era, the positive-sum game. It is the liberation of human energy to do its appropriate job. It's the operation of creation using the only counter-entropic force we have: free human energy.\n\nYou can see it work everywhere from the research lab to the front office to the construction site. It is what drives the entrepreneur to develop and produce a new product or service. And it is what gives the construction worker pride when his skills overcome a difficult problem, turning his blueprints into a functional structure. Why is the construction worker proud and why does the entrepreneur exult? Because they have done the one thing that all humans have the impulse to do, to create something good that would not have been otherwise.\n\nHuman energy is the great creative force in the world. Without it, things tend to entropy. (As the second law of thermodynamics states, ‚Äúclosed systems tend to entropy.‚Äù) Without active and creative human energy, everything goes back to an animal level of existence.\n\nThis human energy does not function by obedience and compulsion. It cannot, no matter how many rulers wish it were otherwise. Look at the command economies of the dead socialist world. Within several decades, their occupants were reduced to an animal existence. Look at the millennia when constrained people lived at the pleasure of their kings, seeking permissions from rulers to live and work. They continually starved and died. Things began to change only when freelance merchants began living according to their own minds and breaking away from the permissions of their rulers.\n\nWhen human energy is free to move, creativity goes wild, as do motivation, happiness, and the accumulation of wealth. When it is restrained, the descent to animal existence takes over again.\n\nThe discovery of this fact is what differentiates us from the Middle Ages and not much else. Do you think that people who lived in those dark times were inherently less intelligent than we are? They were not. You and I are their direct descendants, not many generations removed. We are essentially the same.\n\nThe term positive-sum game signifies that this system creates more than the sum of its parts. The only real magic ‚Äî human energy ‚Äî creates more than it started with. Take some raw materials that are of themselves, are of little worth, and when you add human creativity, you can create vehicles, computers, and spaceships. The materials themselves have been around since the creation of Earth. If they could have turned into something great of themselves, they would have done it long ago. But they cannot. It is only when humans manipulate them according to their own ideas that they gain any real value. Thus, five dollars worth of material becomes a product worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThey, who do not play the positive-sum game, instinctively fall back into being motivated by envy. Ultimately, they find reasons to feel that ‚Äúthere are only so many pieces of the pie.‚Äù This is the seed of destruction.\n\nThe next thing they say is, ‚Äúif you have a bigger piece of the pie, then someone else has to have less.‚Äù That is a zero-sum game ‚ÄîThe idea that nothing is really created, just moved from one hand to another. Not only is it false, but it is also the credo of every envious looter who speaks at the ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòequal distribution of wealth‚Äô, but who secretly hopes to get a share of the wealth held by others.\n\nThe real controversy of our time is this: Is human energy allowed to work in the world, or will it be tied down? The miserable experience of communism has taught the world's rulers that the positive sum game is necessary, so their plan is now to allow human energy to work, but to siphon off as much wealth as possible without killing it altogether. We productive people are carrying the governments of the world on our backs. Are worth half of our efforts ‚Äî half of our lives?\n\nThey take half of our earnings away from us continually by a vast web of taxes, fees, and regulations. For what benefit? ‚ÄúTo help the poor‚Äù, they say, and clamorously infer that if you disagree you are a heartless and dangerous person, and further, that all will despise you. But if our money is forcibly taken from us, is it not the state robbing us? Any dictionary will tell you this is so, but it is considered poor form to say so, or to even consider it.\n\nAre the poor better off? Certainly. Some of our money goes to the poor. (Although most is eaten up in the bureaucracy.) This feeds their bellies insufficiently, while at the same time locking them into a life of dependence that wages an unending war upon their souls. Is that a good thing? Are the poor better off for this robbing of producers and living in a state of dependency?\n\nMany of you will gasp and reel in shock that I would challenge the respectability and honor of your tradition, and you fear to let yourselves consider my case. You have come up against someone who does not share in your conspiracy of compliance. You must either turn away from these subjects or face the prospect of becoming a radical, and of people saying bad things about you.\n\nAre you angry? If so, it is not because I am wrong. If that were the case, you would simply turn away. You are angry because I am ill-mannered enough to bring up subjects that you wish to avoid. My ideas bother you. When they come up, you divert your mind to pat praises like, ‚Äúwell, that's the price we pay for our society.‚Äù You dodge reason and shunt your thoughts away in order to keep your mental comfort level. You do not face these ideas head-on because you are afraid of them. You are afraid that you might have to agree with them. And then you would have to face the choice of either to be a hero or to be a coward.\n\nI stood one evening in IBM Plaza in Chicago, looking over the riverfront skyline as the sun sank in the southwest, and I realized that the towering monuments to human effort in front of me were the results of the positive sum game run at only half speed. Chicago was wild and open from the 1830s through the 1890s, then slowly the curves and limits were imposed by do-gooder government and collectivist types. These inevitably slowed the workings of a city that had, as a writer once said, been geared for giants. But the restraints were not enough to stop the positive sum game, only to slow it down. Only enough to slow it down.\n\nThe Chicago skyline I watched was the result of the positive-sum game being played at half-speed. Yet, its results were awesome. I thought about what might have been if it were allowed to operate unfettered. And then I thought of the greatest example of the positive-sum game during my lifetime: Hong Kong. It went from rice fields to the grandest city of the East in one generation. An explosion of unrestrained human energy.\n\nWhat things we have been deprived of! What glorious accomplishments aborted and still-born! And now our recent explosion of technology has become the target of bureaucrats worldwide. Where will it go from here? Will the positive-sum game once again be strangled? Or will it migrate to new and open lands? But, moving to a new land will be a problem, won't it? There is no land on this planet that is not claimed by some gang of rulers. So until cheap space flight is achieved, there is only one new country to be found: Cyberspace. So escape there we shall. And there we will and must, for our own sake and for the sake of our descendants, establish the positive-sum game without restriction. Toward that end, we have built a private free market. We used our own money to do it and we've broken no laws that we are aware of, save laws that outlaw privacy. Now the rulers are trying to stop us. Why? We want to run an experiment and see if freedom really is better than servitude. Why won't they let us try? Are they interested in the betterment of mankind? Or are they really interested in monopoly powers? All we want to do is be left alone to try freedom. Why is that threatening? And why do they wish to imprison us?",

    "content": "MA: Frances, are you ready?\n\nJF: Yes, I am.\n\nMA: OK, hang on and I‚Äôll post some reasons why these ideas bother\npeople. Take a look through the list, and see which ones seem to fit you.\n\nThe first one probably doesn‚Äôt fit you, but I‚Äôm leaving it in because it does fit a lot of people. Remember also that people don‚Äôt really think about these things, they just react.\n\nMA:\n\n1. Fear of responsibility. Freedom is threatening because it eliminates the possibility of shifting responsibility for your errors onto others. Freedom puts you right out in the open, with no cloak for your mistakes. It also gives you full credit for your successes, but that is seldom considered, as the fear-based impulses are generally stronger.\n\n2. Fear of separation. For a variety of reasons, most people have an\ninstinctual fear of being separate. The feeling is that separation means death. This may be true in some rare situations, and certainly was true more commonly in the distant past, but it is an impulse only, not reason.\n\n3. Rulership as a force of nature. For the last several thousand years,\nnearly all humans have lived and died under some form of rulership. So many generations have come and gone under this arrangement, that it now seems to most people as a force of nature: That which was, is, and shall be. When you mention something different, it causes them  mental stress.\n\n4. No mental image. Because none of us have ever lived in any situation except subjection to state power, we have no mental images of anything different. So, when we start talking about a truly free place with no rulers, the listeners have no images to draw upon. It seems like we are proposing a pointless journey into an unknown and dangerous place. Again, this is a feeling, not reasoned thought.\n\n5. Group conditioning. A central fact of modern social behavior is that almost the entire populace has gone through 11-17 years of social conditioning in the school systems. This conditioning shows up in a variety of ways, especially in dealing with authority figures. The conditioned responses are: Obey authority. Don‚Äôt cause a disruption. Accept the place given to you. Conform. The real effect here is the installing of comfortreactions and discomfort-reactions. Our system flies in the face of almost all of this.\n\n6. Lack of critical thinking skills. For a variety of reasons (which I have not spent the time necessary to properly catalog), the 20th Century saw a mass movement away from respect for reason and toward a devotion to emotion. Have you ever tried to reason with someone who lives by emotion? It is essentially impossible. These people can be influenced by getting them to identify with characters from movies and television, or with celebrities, but seldom by reason. Now, most people aren‚Äôt fully that way, but modern critical thinking skills are disastrous, and a great many people distrust reason, with full faith in emotion. Many of them are beyond hope of recovery, and could be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.\n\n7. Cognitive dissonance. This is what happens to people when they have accepted an idea, or series of complimentary ideas; then, an obviously different idea is presented, and it makes some sort of sense to them. It causes a conflict. This is properly called cognitive dissonance, and it is really just a mental conflict. People don‚Äôt do well with these conflicts; their general reaction is to eliminate them as quickly as possible. The easiest way to do this is to simply drown them out by reciting their original ideas, and trying to convince themselves that the previous ideas are right, and 148 that they should not think about the new idea. Yes, this is dishonest, and yes, it requires denial, but most people prefer it to critical analysis of their existing ideas, and, potentially, changing their minds. Combine this with all the other items shown here, and the conflicts arising from taking on a difficult new idea are too much for many people to bear.\n\n8. Fear of reprisal. This is the simplest one. Think of an IRS audit, an FBI raid, or of Stalin. Obviously the rulers won‚Äôt like our free markets. It is not unreasonable to expect that they will take reprisals against people who displease them. A very reasonable concern.\n\n9. Fear of the world falling apart. The central myth of the nation-state is that it is necessary to hold civilization together; that without it, we would all degenerate quickly into killers and thieves. This has been repeated so frequently and so consistently, that most people accept it as fact, even though if asked to provide evidence, they have none. Actual analysis of this idea leads to a contrary conclusion, but that does not stop the impulse of fear. Very few people have ever questioned the nation-state myth at all.\n\nI suggest that you print this out, take a few minutes, and think about it. I‚Äôll be in my office for several hours. Just let me know when you are ready.\n\n- Paul Rosenberg,  A Lodging of Wayfaring Men (p. 147-148)\n\n- - -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvfPI1t9Rck",

    "content": "BitBox Lugano Update is here! üéâ\n\nAt BitBox, we want to make sure our users can take advantage of the newest innovations on Bitcoin. With today‚Äôs update, we are adding support for two great Bitcoin features:\n\n- Silent Payments\n- MiniTapscript\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfau.webp \n\nüîí¬†Silent Payments Upgrade\n\nWith this update, the BitBox02 is now the first hardware wallet to support sending to silent payment addresses. This means you can send bitcoin to the same address multiple times, without the sender losing privacy. No need to constantly generate new addresses!\n\nüîß Just enter a silent payment address in the BitBoxApp, and the transaction is created  together with your BitBox02. \n\nThe BitBoxApp then verifies the silent payment was created correctly by the BitBox02 for extra security.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfav.png \n\nüîë¬†This update also brings MiniTapscript, combining the privacy and efficiency of Taproot with the power of Miniscript. It‚Äôs perfect for creating more complex wallet setups like inheritance planning, while keeping transactions smaller and more private.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lfaz.png \n\nWhat is MiniTapscript? \n\nMiniscript is a language that simplifies creating advanced Bitcoin spending conditions, like combining keys or setting time delays (great for inheritance planning).\n\nMiniTapscript adds Taproot‚Äôs privacy and efficiency to Miniscript. Only the part of the script actually used to spend the coins is revealed, which reduces transaction size, lowers fees, and improves privacy.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/LfbD.png \n\nWith MiniTapscript, only the necessary parts of the script are revealed, making transactions more efficient and lowering fees. It‚Äôs available now in firmware version 9.21.0.\n\nWhat else is included in our upgrade? Read more in the blogpost in the comment üëá",

    "content": "In the early days of ecash a common narrative was that it provides \"theoretically perfect anonymity\", but there's more nuance to this. \n\nIt's correct that when the client presents an unblinded signed message, the mint cannot link this to any specific blinded cyphertext that it signed previously. \n\nHowever, there is still three pieces of critical metadata that the client does reveal:\n\n1. The number of inputs and outputs of the ecash transaction. Transactions with many inputs reveal that the same user got paid many times in the past. Transactions with many outputs reveal that one user is making many payments.\n\n2. The value of each input and output. The mint uses a different key for each denomination value of the tokens. Thus a token worth 5 units is easily differentiated from a token worth 10 units. The anonymity set of a token depends on the number of tokens generated, so if a user is the only one with that specific denomination he has no privacy. \n\n3. The IP address that connects to the mint to send the transaction api request. If the same IP address makes multiple payments, it's likely the same user, and his geolocation is also revealed.\n\nProblems 1 and 2 can be mitigated on client side, but this adds substantial complexity in utxo management and transaction structure. If these mitigation are not specified and different clients have slightly different solutions, this opens up additional client fingerprinting attacks.\n\nWabiSabi is designed to solve problems 1 and 2 on a protocol level. A WabiSabi transaction is required to have exactly two inputs and two outputs, and homomorphic value commitments hide the amounts of each input and output. The tradeoff is that the mint has to issue 0 value credentials, a user needs to make more transactions to prepare his desired amounts, and the proof size and creation time is larger.\n\nProblem 3 is addressed by a client side networking anonymity layer. A VPN at least hides the actual users IP address, but if only one client uses this VPN to talk to this mint, it's still one IP per user. Tor is incredibly useful here, as it allows the creation of anonymous onion routes through the network with different exit IP addresses. A client can get a new IP for each api request! This does however increase bandwidth and latency cost.\n\nWe should assume \"everyone knows what the mint knows\", and so we need to be hardcore about privacy protections best baked into the protocol. If the protocol doesn't ensure the security of the user, client devs have to do an exponentially larger amount of research and development to fix the issues client side.",

I strongly believe authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans. Check üßµ for why:\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laim.png \n\nRather than praising bitcoin as a tech paradigm shift √† la petroleum and the internet, the authors introduce the blatantly luddite argument that \"early adopters\" ... \"increase their real wealth and consumption\" ... \"at the expense of [latecomers]\".\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Lain.png \n\nThen they go on to brazenly advocate for legislation ... \"to prevent bitcoin prices from rising or to see bitcoin disappear altogether\" in order to prevent \"the division of society\".\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laio.png \n\nThe authors also model some projections, to illustrate the paltry amount of BTC that will remain available for latecomers. (Woe is me! Conspicuously left out is the reason that has driven 15 years of bitcoin adoption & development: it's simply better tech.)\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/Laiq.png \n\n In all the years I've been monitoring the bitcoin space, this is by far the most aggressive paper to come from authorities. The gloves are off. It's clear that these central bank economists now see bitcoin as an existential threat, to be attacked with any means possible.\n\nMany of us have warned that this was coming: bitcoin as a major political fault line both in national and international elections. Well here it is. It means that us HODLers must take action to insure that governments respect our basic right to hold property.\n\nAnd no, this won't be a war between haves and have-nots. Rather this will be a historic clash between those who stand for the natural rights of the individual, and those who clutch at the failed ideologies of collectivism and central planning.\n\nHere's the download link to the paper: \"The distributional consequences of Bitcoin\".

There has always been confusion over the word \"Free\" in \"Free Software\" and \"Open\" now suffers the same problem (look at all these LLM licenses claiming to be Open Source), and I think \"Freedom Tech\" is a pretty good way of talking about the same thing.\n\nThe Free/Libre Open Source Software community has a lot of overlap and similarity but can be split into two camps:\n\n1. I am truly free if I am allowed to contract myself into slavery (BSD-ish, permissive licensing).\n2. It is not freedom to be allowed to contract myself into slavery (GNU-ish, copyleft licensing).\n\nMaybe that's an unfair or unrealistic characterization but that's how I tend to think of it.\n\nI disagree with a lot of Stallman's views (he's on the left) but the four software freedoms are legit.

A note mixer relay - a simple yet intriguing concept. Essentially, it's a relay that accepts your notes, but instead of store them, it re-signs them with the relay's keys, effectively anonymizing and mixing your notes. This is the npub I'm using for this and where all mixed notes are published nostr:nprofile1qqs80keaa6v84ldnkne66q0qf96rvtf84aj27taw25x3appz83lqspgppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp07t6hp6 . \n\nThis idea isn't entirely new, there was some exploration around group of people sharing an nsec. This is the case of nostr:nprofile1qqswgh9y2cz5qu5upzg5yn47m65t7d697k2dtufa9fq54af80dwng5sprpmhxue69uhkummnw3ezucmgv95k6cfwd9hxvme0qyw8wumn8ghj7cn0wd68ytn0wfskuem9wdukuceww3jkx6p0ksrqpx, for example, it was created during sec01.\n\nIn summary, this note mixer relay will accept your notes, re-sign them with the relay's keys, and then publish them. Does this idea interest you, or does it make sense? Currently, anyone can publish to the relay, but I plan to implement a whitelist for pubkeys based on my contact list. This could also be integrated with a wot relay, allowing you to mix notes from your friends or entire social graph. Perhaps there are some interesting use cases to explore? ü§î\n\nJust a heads up: be careful not to publish to multiple relays, as this will leak your original note, signed by you.",

    "content": "Why I started Sovereign Landing\n\nI've been location independent for over 8 years. Nomadic lifestyle isn't easy, but Sovereign Landing solves my biggest pain...\n\nDuring these 8 years, at times I've attempted to have just one permanent base. Every time I try, reality seems to start sending me subtle or not-so-subtle hints that I shouldn't even be trying that... so I'm now leaning 100% into a semi-mobile lifestyle - permanently.\n\nI'm not constantly moving around because that would be just a ton of wasted energy, but I'm not living anywhere permanently either. A few different places per year.\n\nThis comes with some issues of course. Nomadic lifestyle is especially challenging over the long term - most people who try this just give up. Many find lack of community the worst aspect, but I've never really cared about that - my communities have always been online.\n\nWhat I personally find the most difficult is the actual moving - having to find a new apartment in a new country, and setting it up. That's tolerable to do maybe once, but the frustration compounds over time.\n\nThis happened again in the beginning of 2024. I was busy with life and knew I wanted to go to Tbilisi, Georgia, so I did. I just thought I'd get a temporary Airbnb while I find an actual longer-term rental. Should be easy, right?\n\nWell, it's never that simple, and that hit me once again when I started the apartment hunting process. I remembered vividly what absolute drain of energy it is. It usually means weeks of focus destroyed.\n\nThat's true even if you hire local help, as that hiring process by itself can be long and arduous! If the first person you hire can't get the job done (somewhat likely!) you have to start from scratch - fffffuuuuu...\n\nI did find a good reliable local person in Tbilisi (Nina), and during her apartment hunting I just couldn't help thinking \"if this thing here and that thing there was done slightly differently, this could be like 10-100x easier\". These things kept popping up in my head.\n\nNina was working as a real estate agent part time, and when she mentioned that she could have time for more customers, I just put 1+1+1 together.\n\nI know something about online marketing. Nina is an expert on the local market. And I'm definitely an expert on taking sort-of-functional processes, ripping them apart and turning them into great customer experiences. That's how the idea of Sovereign Landing got started!\n\nI've been building this project primarily with myself as the primary customer avatar, but it's now high time to start getting some market feedback from OTHER people - preferably customers! üòÄ\n\nI'd highly appreciate it if you can check out the site and let me hear your thoughts?\n\nhttps://www.sovereignlanding.com/",

This part of the conversation was such gold that I made it into a separate clip: https://m.primal.net/LJjL.mp4 \n\nThis part of the conversation is about the book Second Realm: https://libertyunderattack.com/product/second-realm-book-on-strategy/ (you can download and listen to it for free)\n\nMy highlights from the conversation in text:\n\n[Gsovereignty]\n\n...We can also orange-pill the world by hiring everyone...\n\n[Max]\nYeah, cause ultimately free people are productive people and productive people want to build stuff...\n\nNot just do we need to produce services and goods in the 2nd realm that cannot be acquired in the 1st realm, but likewise there is a demand in the 2nd realm that cannot be provided or satisfied in the 1st realm... and so then 1st realm agents will migrate into the 2nd realm in order to produce those goods and services for 2nd realm inhabitants.\n\n[Gsovereignty]\nI think I will take that hint and start referring to the bitcoin world as the 2nd realm\n\n[Max]\nYeah it's a perfect fit...\n\n... (Second Realm) It's a book on strategy, how to build a productive parallel society that gets humanity through this dark time of parasitism. We need to have people continuously producing, DESPITE the enormous amount of theft that is going on, and we need to build tools and strategies that make being productive cheaper.\n\nThere is a gigantic demand in this area, and therefore huge opportunities for value creation and profit.\n\nSo, this is ultimately I think what is going for us, like back during the Soviet regime: you had the Soviet economy, centrally planned and everything going to shit and rotting and no value being created at all, and you had the much more liberal western societies with more free market producing enormous amounts of incredible things.\n\nYou just see the two markets and centrally planned slavery societies always underperform property-rights based freedom societies, like always has, always been, will always be... just because of economic reality.\n\nSo in the long run we will see exactly the same thing happening again: the first realm, centrally managed, fiat-controlled and slave/theft based system is going to dwindle and further decrease in capital.\n\nIt will devour itself more and more, and as it is dying it will have to devour itself even at a faster rate, just to keep up. While simultaneously the free world will produce things that we cannot even yet imagine, at a scale we cannot even fathom...\n\n...and that will continue to increase, as we continue to write the code that decreases the cost for doing so, and we're not stopping to write the code!\n\nThe full episode is here: https://fountain.fm/episode/1UPPuhyd3St7E3RCpBsX",

    "content": "NEW CLIENT ANNOUNCEMENT\nhttps://m.primal.net/LDNn.mp4 \nI wanted to build on nostr and I asked OpenSats for a grant to work on ONOSENDAI one day per week. I scaled back my hours at my fiat job and began part time nostr development to work on a novel metaverse project where all actions require proof of work. This was the beginning of my nostr career. Today is a huge milestone in that journey.\n\nIt took me 52 Fridays from proof of concept to reality, and now ONOSENDAI functions as the first cyberspace client.\n\nToday I present to you the thermodynamic update to #ONOSENDAI https://onosendai.tech\n#welcometocyberspace folks. It's finally here. Check it out on desktop for the best experience. More updates for a better Mobile experience are in the pipeline.\n\nI'm working on a video to explain cyberspace and how to use ONOSENDAI and I'll post it ASAP.\n\nThe short tutorial is this:\n- WASD for movement (relative to camera)\n- Q = down, E = up\n- ESC to put camera behind avatar\n- Mouse Click and drag to move camera\n- Mouse Wheel to change Throttle\n\nSections of the app:\n\nLOCAL\nThis is the on-the-ground cyberspace view. The shiny polygon you begin your journey in is your Home Coordinate, which is simply your hex pubkey. Your journey always starts here if you derezz (or get derezzed) at any point, but your progress is saved to nostr and your avatar will travel even when you're away from the app!\n\nSECTOR\nThis is the 10,000ft view of cyberspace. Nearby sectors are automatically scanned for objects of interest and mapped in 3D: other avatars, hyperjumps, shards, and constructs (coming soon).\n\nGLOBAL\nThis is the 100,000,000ft view of cyberspace. The staggeringly large full coordinate system is shown.\n\nBUILD\nThis tab is a 3D editor that lets you build 3D objects called Shards. Shards can be mined and planted wherever you are at in cyberspace for everyone to admire. In the LOCAL tab you can mine and deploy a Shard at your current position. The size and complexity of the shard determines its mining difficulty.\n\nTerminology:\n\n- coord - a cyberspace coordinate is a 256-bit number, just like event ids and public keys.\n- chain - the nostr events representing your movement which contain proof-of-work and are linked together via hash\n- sector - a 2^30 cube area of cyberspace\n- G - Gibson, the unit of measurement in cyberspace named after William Gibson (the author who invented the concept of cyberspace)\n- plane - The last bit in a cyberspace coordinate determines its plane. Depending on your pubkey you will either be in D-Space or I-Space. You will be able to switch planes in a future update. All points in D-Space map to a real point in reality, including Earth. All points in I-Space are virtual.\n\nDespite the polish I was able to muster, ONOSENDAI is still in its infancy, and so is cyberspace. It's up to you to explore, build, discover, and push it forward, because unlike other metaverses, this one belongs to everyone and is controlled by no-one. That's the whole point!\n\nI would like to invite all #cyberspace enthusiasts to join my new ditto instance at https://straylight.cafe and use your nostr identity to ask questions, discuss cyberspace, futurism, and how to build this new world together. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. I want to shut down the ONOSENDAI telegram group in favor of Straylight Caf√© because it's nostr based, so hop on over and make it happen!\n\nWhen you join Straylight.cafe, it isn't connected to any external relays on purpose, so you must edit your profile and customize it for how you want your npub to appear on this site. Whatever you post on Straylight stays there and doesn't go out to the rest of nostr unless you do so manually. It's like an open telegram group -- public, but not broadcasted by default.\n\nAnd so concludes my OpenSats grant. I want to thank so many people for supporting me, encouraging me, and helping me along this journey.\nI am going to try to list everyone I can and I apologize if I miss someone:\nOpenSats and the whole team there\nGsovereignty and Bitkarrot for having me on their podcast. This was a huge break for me into the nostr scene.\nJohns and Marina for encouraging me and inviting me to awesome bolt.fun hackathons which were a wonderful opportunity to meet great people!\nbnonni for being my first ONOSENDAI contributor\nChris for donating to support my work on cyberspace\nlaoc42 \n42pupusas for being the first to build on the cyberspace protocol\nCryptoClay for his enthusiasm and support\nNik, for bringing life and sound to cyberspace with his videos\nPablo for bragging about me and sharing his contagious enthusiasm\nJeffG for answering my NDK questions and being a good bro\nSimon for donating to support my work on cyberspace\nthe FanFares team\nAVERAGE_GARY for thoughtful consideration and friendship\nArtur Brugeman\nJ@n, for having me on his podcast and being an awesome friend\nIoni Appleberg\nMichael Tidwell\nSer Sleepy\nJay\nQuiet Warrior\nAvi\nholdbod\nhzrd149\nMax\nMax Hillebrand\nbiscuits\nmetamick and paula\njonb\nshaun, isaac, yofu, and the yakihonne crew. They throw great hackathons and are wonderful people!\njeanpaul\nFiatjaf\nhttps://m.primal.net/LFjl.png\nStephen Mosher and his crew\nall of my faithful and beloved reply guys who hype me up when I post about cyberspace\nEveryone in the telegram group and everyone who has zapped, tested, and waited patiently for this\nEveryone who believed in me and the skeptics who pushed me to the finish line\n\nThis is just the beginning. Nostr isn't just for tweets. It's for cyberspace, and I think that's a big deal. Thanks everyone üëæüíú\n\n#OTHERSTUFF",

Some of those arrows were, and continue to be, unjust.  Some of those arrows were of my own causing.  I am not perfect.\n\nI don‚Äôt want a perfect world.  I want a world where I‚Äôm not reliant upon the desires of others to control and extort me and where I‚Äôm respected enough to be left alone to do my thing so long as it doesn‚Äôt harm others unjustly.\n\nThe desire to effect this declaration already exists in many of us.  No sane person likes to be controlled or have impositions forced upon him or her.  At the end of the day, we the people give others the power to do things against us.  We sit in relatively quiet outrage, not wanting to rock the boat, not wanting others to perceive us as crazy, and not doing anything about it.  Though, in a sense, participating in #Nostr and #Bitcoin is doing something about it.  It‚Äôs setting a direction toward what we believe is a better and more just society for us to live.  For this I am encouraged that the options are available to each of us to participate or not as we see fit in a way that has not been available to us before.\n\nDecentralization may seem like chaos to some, but that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt yet understand what it is and means.  They don‚Äôt understand that these systems are about taking back control from the privileged few.  The proof is in the pudding.  Our systems seem to be working.  Each of us are free to participate or not in these decentralized systems.  We know the rules ahead of time and we know that change is truly of consensus, rather than this fake show the ruling class foists upon us without consideration of our input or desires. nostr:note10qp726g4zffsgs05l83a5e7hx42rsqhx4urvmtg6g8xtnu4qxjpsgaxy4d",

You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

Spending a taproot input is 16% cheaper compared to spending a native segwit input. Users aren‚Äôt the only ones that benefit - Bitcoin nodes can verify taproot‚Äôs signatures faster than legacy ones, so the entire network gets a little speed boost.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/KvGi.png \n\nüöÄ Faster transaction broadcasting\n\nA more sophisticated transaction broadcasting mechanism was introduced to make the process faster. Transactions are now broadcast to multiple nodes in parallel (through the Tor network) and fail more quickly if the transaction is rejected by the network. Users who upgrade will notice it now takes half as long to send their coins.\n\nüîç Help to setup and find a coordinator\n\nA new message is now shown when no coordinator is configured, along with some help to understand how to find and setup one.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/KvGe.png \n\n‚è´ More accurate CPFP fee estimation\n\nThe CPFP feature now takes into account the fee paid by the parent transaction. In previous releases, the child transaction assumed the parent paid 0 sats in fees, and thus always overpaid for the speed up.. This improvement will be especially significant in high-fee environments, where the CPFP feature is most useful!\n\nüìâ Safer protocol\n\nIn order to avoid introducing unknown incentives and to limit risk to users, the coordination fee concept has been removed. Only coinjoin coordinators that don't charge any coordination fee continue to be supported. Read more: https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/killing-coordination-fee/\n\nü™≤ Backend optimizations\n\nUsers who run a Wasabi backend can now do so with a pruned node and significant CPU/RAM savings. This makes hosting a backend much cheaper and helps to decentralize this component which Wasabi clients still depend on.",

Trading in foreign currency is illegal and businesses are subject to rationing. As a result, there is a growing black market for everything.\n\nElliot Vreeland, son of Nobel Laureate Austrian School economist Dr. Martin Vreeland, learns of his father's apparent death, and is rushed home from school. Elliot learns his father has faked his death to escape arrest by the government agents who are detaining \"radicals\" accused of worsening the economic crisis. Elliot is sent by his father to collect some gold coins stored in case the family has to escape.\n\nUpon returning home, Elliot finds his family missing. Government agents enter the house searching for Elliot, who manages to escape.\n\nElliot becomes acquainted with the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre, an organization plotting the end of the government agents by means of counter-economics. The cadre is strong and organized, and has its militia. Elliot enlists their help, and meets Lorimer, a girl hiding from the government agents; they develop a relationship.\n\nAs the government agents weaken, they tighten controls on communication, travel, and trade. This fails to avert economic collapse, causing the private sector ‚Äì unions, syndicates, and individuals outside of these organizations ‚Äì to control the old infrastructure.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alongside_Night",

I joined them a few times because there wasn‚Äôt much else to do, but for them, it was something a bit more serious‚Äîit was a small but important source of income that they gave to their mothers. It was easy work, and customers appreciated it and tip them for their help.\n\nThen, one day, someone decided to prohibit all forms of child labor. A few years later, the streets were full of kids cleaning car windows, others tried playing violin, singing on the sidewalks or simply asking for money, activities that noone find valuable. \n\nThe sense of pride my friend once had from earning a few pesos by providing a useful service had now been replaced by a naturalized shame of relying on pity from strangers.",

This is the default level and is usually used by people who don't know or don't care about signature levels. A lot of people don't specify the signature level when they sign public keys, so there is no reason to discard these right away.\n\nLevel 1 signature: personal belief but no verification. As the name says this level is used when someone signs a key but was unable to verify the identity. Used for nicknames, most of the time, as you can't really prove the identity behind a pseudonym. Be careful when you encounter a level 1 signature on a key with a full name and e-mail address. These levels have to be specified manually, if someone changes it to level 1, it might be for a reason.\n\nLevel 2 signature: casual verification: These signatures usually mean that people have met and checked identification, but didn't know eachother upfront.\n\nLevel 3 signature: extensive verification: The level used when the signer was absolutely sure that the listed name is correct. Usually this means that they have known eachother in person for years and have checked government issues identification.\n\nhttps://vic.demuzere.be/articles/pgp-public-keys/",

    "content": "A train of thought coming from: \"we can't do ZKPs using sigma protocols or bulletproofs on chain, because we only have ECC operations against one generator (G)\":\n\nImagine one of the very simplest things you can do with 2 generators: proof of discrete log equivalence or DLEQ for short. This is basically the simplest possible generalization of Schnorr; one secret, two bases. This requires two ephemeral commitments (the nonce k mult. the 2 generators) and only one scalar response (one \"signature\", if you like).\n\nOf course, you can't verify such a thing on chain; you can't check sJ = R_2 + hash(..)Q where Q = xJ and P = xG. You can only verify the first version, w.r.t. G: sG = R + eP, which is ofc standard Schnorr, here bip340.\n\nBut .. is there a way adaptors could help? Because an adaptor is something you verify offchain, and so it isn't restricted to one base/ generator.\n\nImagine your goal is \"unlock a payment only if P and Q have the same DL wrt G, J\" (yes I know, bizarre, but I'm fumbling towards the first sentence, here).\n\nObviously if we're including \"verify something offchain before taking an action\", we'll find it sanest to stick to a 2 party protocol first. Let's see:\n\n1. Alice sends Bob P, Q, R1, R2 (having calculated from a random k, R1 = kG, R2 =kJ, and already knowing x_a s.t. Q=x_a J and P=x_a G); her private key is x_a\n2. Alice pays into a 2-2 multisig with Bob, where her key is P, and the aggregate key is Pagg, with U1. When Alice signs it (not yet), the signature will look like:\n\ns_a = k1 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x_a\n\nNotice the +T which will be for an adaptor that Alice adds. This process is already well understood for Schnorr multisig. I am glossing over Musig related details, claiming they don't change the following.\n\n3. Alice provides an adaptor over J for ``spending'' U1. Before writing this out, consider: we want the s-value to be the same over J as it is over G. This is problematic, because the s value comes from a structure that is basically : s = k + e*x, where e is the hash, and as per bip340, that hash *must* be exactly: H(R, P, m) where P is the onchain key, R is the onchain nonce and m is the actual transaction message. So if we do things naively, i.e. make an adaptor over the J base like:\n\ns'J = R2 + H(R2+T, Q, message)Q\n\n.. then we're going to fail to create the desired scenario: that the real signature 's' is the same between the J and G bases. In order to solve this we have to play a trick. We don't change the nonce or public key fields in the hash at all, i.e. we do:\n\ns' = k2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)x\n\nand have Bob verify:\n\ns'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q\n\nSuperficially that is unsound; the reason is that such signatures can be forged if the corresponding nonce point R2 is not fixed into the hash/FS challenge, which it appears it isn't (also not \"key-prefixing\" by including the public key, here Q, in the same challenge is, at the least, problematic). However this can be solved, albeit in an unorthodox way: include both R2 and Q, which are curve points, as data inside the bitcoin transaction! (spending U1). It will just be \"dead\" data (e.g. OP_DROP) because you won't be able to sign against them; they use the wrong basepoint, but it is still easy).\n\n4. Bob verifies this adaptor using (to repeat): s'J =?= R2 + H(R_agg + T, Pagg, txmsg_U1)Q.\n5. Now Bob knows that if he sees the valid s for this equation, he gets the private key t of T w.r.t. J. Importantly, he also knows that if that one s corresponds to the s that is needed to spend U1, then Q and P have the discrete log equivalence property we are proving. But simply convincing Bob of a fact like that is uninteresting in itself; you can do that by simply directly sending him ZKPs of various types. So, :\n6. Alice also provides offchain a DLEQ proof that T = tJ and T2 = tG\n7. Alice makes another adaptor on a payment of another utxo U2, using the same t: s'_2 = k_3 + H(R_3 + T2, P2, m)P2.\n8. Bob now knows that if U1 is spent, it reveals s, proves that DL Q/J = P/G, and that he can spend U2 using s_2 = s'_2 + t, having extracted t from s - s', and knowing that that t value corresponds to T2.\n\nThis could be seen as \"just an adaptor based atomic swap with a bunch of extra steps\", but I'd call it more \"atomic swap gated by DLEQ\", i.e. it will fail unless Q/J = P/G holds.\n\n",

    "content": "Just to define a term (because my pedantic nature recoils at the phrase \"Righteous coercion\") \nCoercion:\n1. The act or practice of coercing. \n2. Power or ability to coerce. \n3. The act or process of coercing. \n4. The application to another of either physical or moral force. When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced. When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact of submission under force. ‚ÄúCoactus volui‚Äù (I consented under compulsion) is the condition of mind which, when there is volition forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion.\n5. Actual or threatened force for the purpose of compelling action by another person; the act of coercing.\n6. Use of physical or moral force to compel a person to do something, or to abstain from doing something, thereby depriving that person of the exercise of free will.\n7. A specific instance of coercing.\n8. Conversion of a value of one data type to a value of another data type. \n9. Using force to cause something to occur. \n\nAs far as my moral understanding none of these definitions can be performed righteously. What I think you are refering to as coercion may very well be defined as just ownership or property rights. When one is said to \"own\" something that is to say they have authoritative control of the use, maintenance, and right to exchange. Your dominion is your property. (God's dominion is everthing and God is the Progenator) Within one's property rule enforcement is not coercion because those on your property have been invited and thus agree to those rules. One cannot agree to coercion. \n\nWhen it comes to government, the only way one might say you \"Agree to the rules\" of citizenship, is to be under the illusion that you chose the government. That IS an illusion. You may be complicit in the government's actions but you have not chosen anything. This lack of free will to choose IS coercion regardless of perceptions of divinity. The scriptures are inspired by God and written by men. In so doing, they are limited by man's understanding of societal structure and dominion. It could very well be that when a polity is made of wicked men, they make a wicked government. But it is not at all clear to me, that individuals working in their own endeavors freely and collaboratively exchanging their goods and services, need a governance structure outside of their moral adherence to God's will. There is no place for interference from the state even if it could somehow act righteously (again I am unsure how taking money without permission can be righteous given the commandment expressly forbidding it.) That claim to Righteous coercion IS the illusion to which I was referring. \n\nI hope that clarifies where I seem to diverge with your view point. Peace and love, Brother.",

Still, if my kids were to do something illegal in public or to someone from a different family, the local authorities would have dominion over justice.\n\nHowever, for justice (and many other things like education/moral formation) within my family, I can exclude a father from another family from intervening in our affairs or, more importantly, excluding the state from teaching things I disapprove of. So, in that sense, I have a monopoly in my position of authority in the family.\n\nThis nuance is articulated as subsidiarity in the Catholic tradition: the principle that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, with higher authorities intervening only when necessary. The concept goes back to at least the 13th century with St. Thomas Aquinas‚Äôs Summa Theologica, but Pope Pius XI used it specifically in his papal encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, which is an important document in the history of Catholic Social Teaching.",

    "content": "I won't elaborate for him but I will add that God created a cosmos in which there is hierarchical forms of rule and authority. Christ is king of all existence. He then deligates authority to lesser powers‚Äîto his heavenly host (like angels) as well as mankind. \n\nMan as God's image bearer is to take dominion of the earth‚Äîto cultivate, subdue, and rule (as God's governors). \n\nGod also subdivided his deligated authority to man into four primary forms of government‚Äîthe church, the magistrate (state), the family, and the individual. Each government has its own specific roles and boundaries‚Äîclergy do not declare war, the magistrate does not administer the sacraments, for example. \n\nWhen man sinned and fell, and all creation was subject to sin, man's governing roles and duties did not change but are now plagued with corruption. Even in a sinful world God did not do away with government. Rather, we are told that God gave the magistrate the sword to reward the just and to punish the unjust. \n\nIn 2 Samuel God says \"When one rules justly over man, ruling in the fear of God, he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass sprout from the earth\"\n\nIn proverbs 29:2, it says \"When the rightelus increase, the people flourish, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.\"\n\nUltimately we are all under the authority and rule of Christ, whether we accept that reality or not, but not accepting it as a peoples results in evil rulers. \n\nWe individually, as households, even as towns and communities and states, can and should resist evil rulers. Part of that resistance is writing code and using open protocols (nostr) and better money (bitcoin). But the heart of that resistance needs to be repentance and a return to rightly ordered rule under the ultimate lordship of Christ.",

After almost all of us paid with sats in turn, the ice was broken. She understood that it was no more difficult or time-consuming for her as a cashier than paying by card. \n\nWhy am I writing this to you? \n\nIf we want to live the bitcoin standard, we need more merchants who accept bitcoin.

    "content": "I've been thinking this through and I've encountered two closely related problems. My outline of the naive approach is: see the \"Vcash\" section of the Curve Trees paper. The \"pour\" algorithm already does most of what you want. You build a tree of utxo pubkeys, more exactly tags of the form G__nll =hash(pubkey)G_t to use the notation of the paper. Then for each of yours, you build the commitment as C_i = v_iG_v + G_nll_i + r_i H where v is the value of the coin and r_i is a random chosen by the prover to blind the commitment. So far so normal. Then you use CurveTrees' \"Selectandrerandomise\" algo to get C_rr,i (rr means 're-randomized' commitment) along with a proof of its validity (i.e. a proof that it's in the tree.\n\nAfter doing this for every one of your utxos, you then need to attach a second zero knowledge proof, a minor adaptation of \"pour\" in Fig 6 of the paper: instead of proving zero balance from summing ins and outs in a transaction, you prove \"commitment to my claimed balance minus the sum of commitments to the list I've given has value 0\". You also need to attach a range proof for each one of the outputs, but this is also handled by spend/pour in the paper.\n\nBut in that lies the problem: if I claim an exact amount, say 100 BTC, and I have to provide a list of N utxos, I've provided already too much information, in the general case: with a very specific amount and a number it's almost trivial (usually) to crunch the public utxo set and figure out the subset that gives the exactly correct total sum. I only see two directions to correct this problem. Use a proof of range instead of exact balance (prove x > y instead of x == y), but this can be surprisingly much more difficult than proving exact values in zero knowledge. Or, some form of aggregation to avoid leaking the number of items (so instead of one c_rr per one of your keys, somehow aggregating the selectandrerandomize? not sure if that actually even makes sense ...).\n\n\nnostr:nevent1qqs90g0yjyl3a4k28tqed65fpuynn06gu6566n2x4ndftwz33ft7w4cpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsrz0tl7",

To recap:\n\nyou want to prove that you own a total of T BTC, but privately. But revealing exact amount may make it too easy to deanon. So I have a proof of this statement: \"I own N utxos, whose total value is between k and k + 2^n, for some k and n that I announce, but I am not revealing which N utxos they are, or what their individual values is, out of a given list of 300k utxos\". The code at https://github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct/tree/auditing now does this.\n\nSee the latest commit note. In brief you need 3 or 4 components to the proof: 1/ a proof that each blinded commitment is part of that 300k set, 2/a proof that each committed value, when summed together, lies in the given range (using bulletproofs), and 3/ key images per utxo to ensure you dont' cheat by just claiming the same utxo multiple times.\n\nnostr:nevent1qqsqc8wgf8w74sh2sjfpjgw4lpp7sp08vfvgpc7dvljewn3cq4grscgpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsygr8twz0ua0zz64eglr58rh9r898wafhdh0stkklhf3830gp9cwh9qpsgqqqqqqsxpc8jd",

    "content": "NWS works with and without encrypted transport. There are lots of different flavors to explore. \n\nWhen used without encryption, the entry node must be run by the user themselves because public entry nodes would be able to listen in otherwise. Two options in those cases: run the entry node locally in tandem with your (unmodified) client, or skip the entry node and modify the client so that data is sent through nostr to the exit node directly (the client is the entry node).\n\nWhen used with encryption, the entry node can also be public. If the encryption doesn't rely on certificate authorities, it just works. You have to make sure you're talking to the right person, but that problem is as old as computer science. For example, ssh will ask you to confirm the fingerprint of the server when you connect.\n\nIf the encryption is https and the certificate was issued for a normal domain, your browser will complain (do you trust this website?) and the user will have to say \"let me pass, even if insecure\". Without ugly hacks (issuing your own root cert for example), I don't know ways to circumvent this. Note that Tor services doen't support https and they don't have to since transport is always Sphinx-encrypted (even hidden from the entry node).\n\nHow do you make sure you're talking to the right server if you use https? Couldn't the entry node just send your traffic somewhete else? We can actually do something that is unique to Nostr here: the exit node can publish its own TLS certificate on nostr and sign it. That's right, you don't need an authority to do that for you if you remain within the NWS system. Clients can fetch the cert from nostr before talking to the entry node and verify against that cert. \n\nHere is another cool part that we haven't talked about yet: the exit node can also be configured to reach the global Internet and not only a local service (we call this NWS v2). In those cases, NWS can be used a bit like a VPN. You can type \"https google dot com\" in your browser and your encrypted traffic would flow from your machine to the entry node, to the exit node, then to Google and back to you. on those cases, nobody complains about the certificate because everything is fine.\n\n\nExciting shit.

Do not delay.\n\n- Use a strong, high entropy passphrase to make bruteforcing the device credential impossible if secure element is ever exploited.\n\n- Set GrapheneOS auto reboot time accordingly so encrypted data goes back at rest when the phone reboots, which makes AFU exploitation impossible. The lower the better.\n\n- Enable duress password. Set it to something easy to trigger but not easy to misfire.\n\n- Turn your phone off in a high risk situation, and trigger duress when in a duress situation.\n\n- Disable your radios when not using them (turn off Wi-Fi, use airplane mode, disable NFC, UWB etc.) for attack surface reduction.\n\n- Set an appropriate USB port control or disable the USB port so they aren't able to connect a device to it.\n\n- Use user profiles (application data and user files within profiles are stored encrypted with separate credentials).\n\n- Enable upcoming GrapheneOS security features like second factor authentication unlock when they come out.\n\n- Communicate only over secure messaging. Some apps like Molly (Signal fork) have features to encrypt the app storage with a passphrase, which access to that app's data impossible even when a profile is compromised  providing the passphrase is secure enough.\n\n- Become disassociated to data. Learn to only keep files or other data as long as it is necessary. If you have no use for them for a long time, then back it up elsewhere, encrypted. Delete anything you don't have a use for in the present. Your data is not your memories. \n\n- Remember that you are only as secure as the people you trust.

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and servile people will believe these lies, at least at first. We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses. Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society. \n\nFree, unashamed men cannot be ruled. \n\n# We are The Free and The Unashamed.",

With NWS, you can host any existing web application on Nostr without having to use DNS or even announce your public IP to the world, simply by sharing your service's npub (or nprofile).\n\nTry it out the demo yourself. Here is a Cashu test mint running with NWS. Let's use curl to retrieve the mint's information. The request travels from your computer to the public NWS entry relay, then through nostr to the service's NWS exit relay. At the other end is a Cashu mint with HTTPS encryption.\n\n```\ncurl -s -x socks5h://relay.8333.space:8882 https://nprofile1qqs8a8nk09fhrxylcd42haz8ev4cprhnk5egntvs0whafvaaxpk8plgpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuwpnxvejuumsv93k2g6k9kr/v1/info --insecure | jq\n```\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTMl.png \n\nI can't stress this enough: THE MINT RUNS BEHIND HTTPS!\n\nThe NWS entry relay can't read your traffic. It's encrypted. We can host public entry relays that can be used by anyone.\n\nThis means we can plug the entire internet to it üåê.\n\nLet's plug it into Cashu for now. Nutshell wallet supports socks5 proxies (that's how it uses Tor). By setting the public entry relay as the proxy, the wallet can now connect to a mint's npub/nprofile and communicate with it via NWS.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTot.png \n\nThis is going to be so freaking cool. And it's going to be a lot more useful than just for Cashu. There are still bugs and issues that need to be ironed out but the code is coming out soon. Watch this space.",

    "content": "#dev #CLN\n\nI've spent the last few workdays completely reworking our onion message code.  This was scattered in various places and I wanted to unify it, and also written several years ago and I'd forgotten how the protocol actually works!\n\nonion messages are *double* encrypted; this is the main source of confusion!  At the high layer, they're a series of nested encrypted calls (\"onionmsg_tlv\" in the BOLT 4 spec), so each recipient decrypts and hands it on: this is exactly the same as we use for payment information.  But inside that is *another* encrypted blob (onionmsg_tlv.encrypted_recipient_data), which requires a tweak which was handed to you alongside the onion, for you to decrypt (into an \"encrypted_data_tlv\").  Inside that is all the information about where to send next, any restrictions, and allows you to calculate the *next* tweak to hand on (it can also override the next tweak).\n\nThe double encryption is necessary because there are *three* actors here: Alice wants Bob to send her a message, without revealing her identity. So she gives Bob a \"blinded path\" which goes via Charlie: this path contains Charlie's pubkey (where to start the path), a blinding tweak, and two encrypted blobs for Alice to put into each layer of the onion message.  The first an encrypted blob which Charlie can read, which contains her pubkey so he knows where to send it next.  The second is her own, and contains a secret specific to the purpose of this message, so Bob can't play games trying to use this blinded path for anything else (\"hey, are you the same node as this previous payment?\") or use a different blinded path for this purpose.  She can also add dummy hops (we don't yet), which she will simply absorb, to obscure the path length from Bob.  You can add padding to make the hops indistinguishable (we don't yet).\n\nBob puts the actual stuff he wants to send Alice into the final onion call (often including his own blinded reply path!), along with the encrypted blob.\n\nImportantly, even if Bob were sending a message *not through a blinded path* he would use the same double-encrypted format: that's so Charlie can't tell whether a blinded path is being used or not, even though it's slightly less efficient.  Crypto is cheap these days, too.\n\nNow, if Alice gives Bob a blinded path to Charlie and Charlie is Bob's peer, he can simply send the onion and the first blinding tweak to Charlie.  But if Alice needs to send the message via Dave to Charlie, she needs to prepend a step.  That's not quite possible, naively, because blinding tweaks are generated *forwards*, and she needs Charlie to get the right blinding tweak from Dave, and Alice has no way of making that happen.  So inside Dave's encrypted blob, she uses next_blinding_override to tell Dave to hand that blinding override to Charlie instead of the normal one.  I just implemented this for Core Lightning (previously we would simply connect to the first node, which is privacy-compromising and should only be done as a last resort).\n\nThese blinded paths have some nice properties: you can't use part of them (you don't know the blinding factor except for the first one, so you can't start in the middle, and you can't replace any data), you need to use all of them.  They can contain timelimits to avoid easy probing, too: a classic measure would be to see if the path fails when a given node is down, but that takes time.  The spec insists all errors within the blinded path are the same, and originate from the entry: this loses some analytical power on failure, but makes probing harder.  The entry point is supposed to add a random delay (we don't yet!).  There may still be implementation differences, but they're hard for Bob to probe (and Alice doesn't need to, as she set up the path).\n",
